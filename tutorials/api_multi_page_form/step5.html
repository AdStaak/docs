	<p>
		At this point, you've done 95% of the work. Now you just need to put through a test
		submission so that Form Tools knows what form content to store.
	</p>

	<p>
		Log into Form Tools (as the administrator) and on the Forms page, click on "Add Form".
		Continue to step 3 and click on the second "Code" option. There, it will have generated
		a line of PHP which looks like this (X will be your form number):
	</p>

{% codemirror php %}
$fields = ft_api_init_form_page(X, "initialize");
{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		Copy that line and overwrite the corresponding line in your form page.
	</p>

	<p>
		{% include screenshot.html item='i98' %}
		After saving, go to your "thankyou" page in your browser to ensure that sessions have
		been deleted, then go back to your form. Here, fill in <b>every</b> field in your form
		and click submit. You should see something like the screenshot to the right.
	</p>

	<p>
		Return to Form Tools, click the "refresh page" button at the bottom of the page, then
		click "Next Step Â»" to continue adding your form.
	</p>
