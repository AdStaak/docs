	<p>
		This step is very much like the previous. Add the following to the top of your pages. Note
		that the <b>ft_api_init_form_page()</b> line doesn't contain any parameters - that's
		important!
	</p>

	{% codemirror php %}
<?php
require_once("path/to/form_tools/global/api/api.php");
$fields = ft_api_init_form_page();
$params = array(
  "submit_button" => "submit_button_name_attribute",
  "next_page" => "next_page.php",
  "form_data" => $_POST,
  "no_sessions_url" => "first_page_in_form.php"
);
ft_api_process_form($params);
?>
	{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		Like before, you'll need to tweak the following for each form page:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			The path to the api.php file has to be updated for your server.
		</li>
		<li>
			Change "submit_button_name_attribute" to the name attribute of your form submit button.
		</li>
		<li>
			Change "next_page.php" to the next page in the form sequence. This should be different
			for each form page.
		</li>
		<li>
			Again, as before, if your form contains file fields, add one more parameter to the $params array: the last
			<b>file_data</b> row.

{% codemirror php %}
$params = array(
  "submit_button" => "submit_button_name_attribute",
  "next_page" => "next_page.php",
  "form_data" => $_POST,
  "file_data" => $_FILES
);
{% endcodemirror %}

		</li>
		<li>
			Since generally you don't want people linking directly to the 2nd or 3rd page of your form -
			you want them to start on page 1 - the "no_sessions_url" parameter to this function lets
			you protect against this. It checks to see if sessions exist (i.e. were created on the
			first page of the form). If they weren't it boots the user out to the file specified. This
			can be an absolute or relative URL.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h4>One Last Thing</h4>

	<p>
		On the final page of your form - the page BEFORE your "thank you" page - you'll want to make
		one last change. When the user clicks SUBMIT on that page, that's the point at which you'll
		want the form submission to be marked as complete, or "finalized". Add one additional
		parameter to the $params array:
	</p>

{% codemirror php %}
"finalize" => true
{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		So, your code will look something like this:
	</p>

{% codemirror php %}
<?php
require_once("path/to/form_tools/global/api/api.php");
$fields = ft_api_init_form_page();
$params = array(
  "submit_button" => "submit_button_name_attribute",
  "next_page" => "next_page.php",
  "form_data" => $_POST,
  "finalize" => true
);
ft_api_process_form($params);
?>
{% endcodemirror %}


{% include close_section.html %}
