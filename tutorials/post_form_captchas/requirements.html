	<p>
		In order to add a reCAPTCHA to your form, you first need to ensure the following steps are
		complete.
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>You need to have the API installed. To get the latest version of the API either do a
			standard upgrade by clicking on the "Check for Updates" button on the Settings
			Â» main tab, or visit the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/api/">API main page</a>.</li>
		<li>You need to create a reCAPTCHA account on their website. I know it's a pain, but
			it's very quick. <a href="http://recaptcha.net/whyrecaptcha.html" target="_blank">Visit
				their site here</a> and sign up for an account. Once you've created an account you
			register the domain(s) where you're using the service. Since the API only runs on the
			same server as your Form Tools installation, you'll only need to set up the one
			domain.<br>
			<br>
			Recaptcha will generate two keys for you: a private and a public one. Add
			those two values to your <b>/global/config.php</b> file, like so:

{% highlight php startinline %}
$g_api_recaptcha_private_key = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";
$g_api_recaptcha_public_key = "yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy";
{% endhighlight %}

			(replace the x's and y's with your own keys).
		</li>
		<li>Your form page need to be a .php file (or whatever file extension is used for PHP on your
			server)</li>
	</ol>
