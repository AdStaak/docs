    <p class="alert alert-warning">
        This tutorial is for <b>Form Tools 3 only</b>. Google deprecated the old reCAPTCHA v1 method which was used
        by Form Tools 2.
    </p>

	<h3>Overview</h3>

	<p>
		If you find your form has become subject to spammers, adding a CAPTCHA is a standard way to cut down
        on spam. CAPTCHA is an acronym for <i>Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans
        Apart.</i> There are many types of CAPTCHA out there. The Form Tools API provides an easy integration
        with reCAPTCHA V2 - a Google service - that shows an "I'm not a robot" checkbox in your form that users
        must click in order to submit the form.
	</p>

	<p>
		Please note, this only works for forms that are found on the same website as your Form Tools installation.
