	<p>
		Form Tools comes bundled with both PHP and JS validation scripts, which it uses internally
		to ensure fields within the application's own forms are entered correctly. This tutorial
		explains how to utilize this PHP validation script in your own forms, what features if
		offers, how to add it to your forms and where to go for further information. Since there's
		an awful lot of validation rules, this tutorial won't give a definitive discussion of
		each feature - that is handled by the <a href="http://www.benjaminkeen.com/software/php_validation/">script's
		documentation</a>. Instead it'll just aim to give an explanation of the whole process. It's
		not too tricky - hopefully you'll be up and running in no time!
	</p>

	<p class="notify">
		<b>Note</b>: currently, you cannot add server-side (PHP) validation to POST or "direct
		submission" forms. This feature is only for forms that submit their content via the API.
	</p>

	<p>
		The validation script is found in the <b>/global/code/validation.php</b> file, but this
		file it automatically included when you include the API in your forms.
	</p>

	<p><b>Pre-requisites</b></p>

	<p>
		For this tutorial we're assuming that your form has already been configured
		with the API and the form submissions
		are being added to Form Tools. If you're not quite at that juncture yet, see one of
		the following tutorials:
