<p>
    IPN is a service provided by PayPal that automatically notifies your server the instant a
    transaction occurs. This lets us ensure that all successful payments get marked as "paid"
    in our Form Tools database.

<p>
    And here's the other piece of good news: you don't really need to know how it works. The
    zipfile contains a file with all the functions needed to interact with PayPal to confirm
    a purchase and mark the submission as complete. So... let's get started setting
    up your form!
