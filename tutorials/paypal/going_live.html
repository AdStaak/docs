<p>
    And finally, it's time to go live! All you need to do to push it live is to change
    that one value in your <b>/includes/library.php</b> file. Change this line:
</p>

{% codemirror php %}
$pp["url"] = "https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr";
{% endcodemirror %}

<p>
    to this:
</p>

{% codemirror php %}
$pp["url"] = "https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr";
{% endcodemirror %}

<p>
    All this does is direct your form to use the live PayPal online payment gateway, not the
    sandbox (developer) area. If ever you need to switch back to testing your form, you can
    just revert the value in this line again.
</p>

<p>
    If necessary, change the $pp["business"] line in /includes/library.php to your real
    paypal address. Personally I always test with the actual business address, but that's
    just me.
</p>
<p>
    And you're done!
