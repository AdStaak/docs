<p>
    In my experience, working with PayPal is like pulling teeth. I find their interface deeply unintuitive and
    convoluted and their documentation - although extensive - virtually impossible to navigate. There seems to be
    dozens of ways to do the same thing only with slight variations. If I had any other choice for online payments,
    I'd leap at it in a second. But I don't: PayPal is the worldwide standard so we have to suck it up and learn to do
    things their way!

<p>
    This tutorial explains how to add a simple donation form to your website. I've included a zipfile (see below)
    containing all the files you need and comes with all the really nasty stuff preconfigured.
</p>

<p>
    Although this tutorial is about setting up a donation form, you can apply anything you learn here to add any
    PayPal-enabled form, such as a shopping cart for ordering merchandise. Also, although this is about PayPal, the
    same general process applies for most external payment gateways - so if any any point you want to jump ship and use
    Google Checkout, WorldPay or something else, you can still learn a lot just by understanding the process described
    herein.
</p>
<p>
    The bulk of this tutorial is less to do with Form Tools than it is PayPal. Most of the work is figuring out how to
    send and receive information from PayPal in a format they require. Hooking it up to Form Tools is actually fairly
    simple, although conceptually may prove a little confusing at first if you're not familiar with using the Form
    Tools API method of submitting your form. The tutorial begins with a top-down discussion of the entire process. I
    chose to start with the abstract process rather than the details because it really is vital that you understand
    precisely what you're trying to do. It's not the sort of task you can just implement then understand in retrospect -
    you'd be unlikely to succeed setting up your form without knowing what's going on first!
</p>
<p>
    As always, I've tried to keep this tutorial as simple as possible for the not-so technical folks. But here are the
    requirements:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Basic PHP and HTML knowledge</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/">A PayPal account</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://developer.paypal.com/">A PayPal developer's account</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/formtools/misc/blob/master/PayPal%20Donation%20Form.zip?raw=true">This zipfile</a>.
        It contains a number of pre-built pages for implementing a form on your site.</li>
    <li>A strong cup of coffee. Or two. Or possibly three.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    All of the above points will be discussed below. You can see an example of a PayPal enabled form with Form Tools'
    own <a href="{{site.ft_url}}/donate/">donation form</a>. If this tutorial comes in handy, how about seeing it in
    action and making a donation? ;-)
