{% include open_section.html nav='nav_tutorial_paypal.html' selected='configure_form' nav_width=3 %}

<p>
    You will need to configure the PHP script to send the appropriate values to
    PayPal for processing. Even though it does currently redirect to PayPal, you need to
    do some additional configuration to ensure all the values passed are correct.
</p>
<p>
    Open up the <b>/includes/library.php</b> file and edit the following
    lines, found at the very top.
</p>

{% codemirror php %}
// your paypal email address
$pp["business"] = "joebloggs@something.com";

// your website root URL
$pp["site_url"] = "http://www.formtools.org";

// where the user is directed to after successful payment
$pp["success_url"] = "/donate/success.php";

// where the user is directed to after cancelled payment
$pp["cancel_url"] = "/donate/cancelled.php";

// the location of the ipn.php file
$pp["notify_url"] = "/donate/ipn.php";

// The currency code [USD,CAD,GBP,JPY,EUR]
$pp["currency_code"] = "CAD";

// "fso": fsockopen, "curl": cmd line, "libCurl": PHP compiles with libCurl
$pp["post_method"] = "fso";
{% endcodemirror %}

<p>
    For the success_url, cancel_url and notify_url values, you need to set them to the location
    of those files - included in the zipfile - relative to your webroot. The default examples
    assume you've uploaded the zipfile into a "donate" folder.
</p>
