<p>
    Next, if you have a Premier or Business account, you'll need to make a small configuration change
    to your PayPal settings.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.paypal.com">Log into PayPal</a></li>
    <li>Click on your "Profile" tab</li>
    <li>Click on "Instant Payment Notification Preferences"</li>
    <li>
        Check the "Instant Payment Notification" checkbox and enter in the URL of your ipn.php
        file (located in the zipfile) into the Notification URL field. Don't worry: you can
        override this URL for any form, so you can use the same PayPal email to accept payments on
        multiple sites.
    </li>
</ul>
