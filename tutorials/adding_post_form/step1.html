<p>
    Step 1 is just a preparatory page. It makes a few general comments and provides a short
    checklist to ensure you're ready to start adding your form. Specifically, these two criteria
    need to be met:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>your form has already been created and it's accessible via a URL (localhost is fine)</li>
    <li>you are able to edit your form</li>
</ul>

{% include close_section.html %}
