    So far so good! Form Tools has now received your test submission; the vast majority of
    the technical stuff is done. You haven't quite reached the point where you're cracking
    open the champagne, but you're getting close.
</p>

<p>
    Now it's mostly just a matter of configuring your form fields to make them look and behave
    like you'd expect within the Form Tools UI. This step gathers information about your
    fields so that it can create a custom database table to store all future form
    submissions. Here's what all the columns and features of this page mean:
</p>


<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-3">Order</div>
    <div class="col-lg-9">
        This field determines the default order of your form fields as they will be listed
        in the administration pages. Generally you'll want to arrange these in a logical manner,
        but it doesn't terribly matter: every time the administrator or client looks at the form
        data it will be through a View. Each View can be sorted in whatever way you want.
    </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-3">Form Field Name</div>
    <div class="col-lg-9">
        The name of your form field. This is included for reference, so you can see at a glance
        what the row is all about.
    </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-3">Display Name</div>
    <div class="col-lg-9">
        The display name should uniquely identify your field within your form. It should serve
        as a simple label like "First Name", "Email", "Contact Phone Number" or something along
        those lines. The <b>Smart Fill</b> button makes it's best guess at filling in the
        display names based on the names you've given your form fields.<br />
        <br />
        Tip: if you'd like the Smart Fill option to work as effectively, you'll need to format
        your form fields with underscore notation, like so <b>company_name</b>, <b>first_name</b>
        and <b>email</b>. These get Smart-Filled as <b>Company Name</b>, <b>First Name</b> and
        <b>Email</b> respectively. Smart Filling works by converting all underscores
        to spaces and then uppercasing the first letter of each word.
    </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-3">Sample Data</div>
    <div class="col-lg-9">
        This column is again included just for reference: it shows the contents of the field
        that was originally submitted.
    </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-3">Field Size</div>
    <div class="col-lg-9">
        This column determines how much storage should be allocated for this field in the
        database. This field is a common source of error. If you ever see your data get chopped
        off in the UI, or find that fields with field options groups (dropdowns, checkboxes &
        radios) sometimes don't show up properly, it's probably because the form data got
        truncated.<br />
        <br />
        There are five field sizes. Don't pick the option that fits MOST data for this field, but
        for ALL data. Even if 99% of your fields will be under 20 characters, if there's one field
        that could be 21 characters pick the <b>Medium</b> field size.<br />
        <ul>
            <li>Tiny &lt;= 5 chars</li>
            <li>Small &lt;= 20 chars</li>
            <li>Medium &lt;= 256 chars</li>
            <li>Large (TEXT) - 65,535 characters</li>
            <li>Very Large (MEDIUMTEXT) - 16,777,215 characters</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
