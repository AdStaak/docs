    This page lists all of your form fields and lets you "Smart Fill" them (i.e. set their
    field types and contents) at the click of a button.

<h3>Limitations: checkboxes and radio buttons</h3>

<p>
    Due to the nature of HTML, checkboxes and radio buttons have their labels located <b>outside</b> of the input
    field elements: technically they could appear anywhere in the webpage. For instance:
</p>

<textarea class="codemirror" data-lang="html">
&lt;!-- field types with their labels found outside of the element --&gt;
&lt;input type="radio" name="r" /> My first radio!
My second radio: <input type="radio" name="r" /&gt;

&lt;input type="radio" name="c" /> My first checkbox
My second checkbox: <input type="checkbox" name="c" /&gt;

&lt;!-- field types with their labels found inside the element --&gt;
    &lt;option value&gt;="one"&gt;One&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value="two"&gt;Two&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value="three"&gt;Three&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select>
</textarea>

<p>
    {% include screenshot.html item="i56.jpg" %}
    Because of this, the Smart Fill feature doesn't pre-fill the display texts for checkboxes or
    radio buttons, since it doesn't know where to find them! Dropdowns always have their labels
    found in the same place, so they CAN be pre-filled.
</p>

    Once you've finished configuring your form fields, click the "Next Step" button to continue.
