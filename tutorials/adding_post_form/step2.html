    Step 2 is where you enter all the main settings for your form. The screenshot to the right shows some demo
    settings, but you should enter the values that are relevant for your own form. Here's what all the fields mean.

<div class="clear"></div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-3">
        <strong>Form Name</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-9">
        This is used within Form Tools to uniquely identify your form. If you're planning on
        adding lots of forms, it's important to give them the most descriptive names possible.
        On the form list page, you will be able to search the forms on what you enter here.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-3">
        <strong>Form URLs</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-9">
        Enter the URL of your form.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-3">
        <strong>Redirect URL</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-9">
        This is the URL of the final "thank you" page, where users will be redirected to after they
        have successfully submitted the form.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-3">
        <strong>Who can access?</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-9">
        This setting determines who can view the form. You will later be able to
        further customize these permissions by creating separate form
        <a href="https://docs.formtools.org/userdoc/views/">Views</a>.
    </div>
