    This tutorial explains how to add a simple POST form for storage in Form Tools. This example
    uses a "contact us" form - but the actual form fields don't make any difference; the
    information supplied here works perfectly well for any sort of form data.
</p>

<p>
    So! First step is to log into Form Tools and go to the Forms page. There, at the bottom of
    the page you should see a button labeled "Add Form" (see screenshot). Click it! This
    takes you to the first page in a series of pages, designed to simplify the process of
    adding and configuring your form. Each step needs to be completed to successfully add your
    form for storage by Form Tools. If you are unable to finish setting up your form in one
    sitting, no problem! The values you've entered for each page are stored in memory so you
    can pick up where you left off. Again, to keep things simple, the Add Form process only
    shows a subset of all configurable options; things like setting up auto-emails and Views
    can be set after the form has been successfully added.

    The following pages examine each of the six steps of the Add Form process. For early
    devotees of the script, you may want to pay close attention to the following pages:
    the Add Form process has been significantly improved from earlier versions.
