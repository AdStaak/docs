	<p>
		Make sure your form has been given a .php extension (the API requires your files to be
		PHP files - not HTML), then add the following PHP to the very top of your page with a
		few minor modifications listed underneath:
	</p>

	{% codemirror php %}
<?php
require_once("path/to/form_tools/global/api/api.php");
$fields = ft_api_init_form_page("", "test");
$params = array(
  "submit_button" => "submit_button_name_attribute",
  "next_page" => "thanks.php",
  "form_data" => $_POST,
  "file_data" => $_FILES,
  "finalize" => true
);
ft_api_process_form($params);
?>
	{% endcodemirror %}

	<ul>
		<li>The path to the api.php file has to be updated, depending on where it's located in
			relation to your form.</li>
		<li>Change "submit_button_name_attribute" to whatever the name attribute of your form
			submit button may be. If it doesn't have one, add it!</li>
		<li>Change "thanks.php" to whatever page you want to redirect to, after the form has been
			submitted.</li>
		<li>You can omit the "file_data" line if your form doesn't contain any file upload fields.</li>
	</ul>

	<br>

	<p>
		Next, make sure your form tag looks like this:
	</p>

	{% codemirror php %}
<form action="<?php echo $_SERVER["PHP_SELF"]?>" method="POST">
	{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		$_SERVER["PHP_SELF"] is just a PHP value for the location of the current page. This
		makes the form <b>submit the information to itself</b>. The ft_api_process_form
		function will take care of redirecting to the next page for you. One of the nice
		things about posting the submission to itself is that if later on, you choose to add
		server-side validation (<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/php_validation/">see
		this tutorial</a>), it's very easy to handle and display the errors on the same page.
	</p>

	<p>
		It's generally a better idea to use $_SERVER["PHP_SELF"] instead of the name of the file,
		since filenames sometimes change. If that happens, you'd need to remember to update the
		action attribute. But by using the PHP variable, you don't have to worry about it!
	</p>


	<p>
		With regard to the form's post attribute, if you want to use method="GET", that's fine - just change the PHP line in the top of the from:
	</p>

	{% codemirror php %}
"form_data" => $_POST,
	{% endcodemirror %}

	to:

	{% codemirror php %}
"form_data" => $_GET,
	{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		Finally, put through a form submission. You should be redirected to your "thank you" page.
		So far so good!
	</p>

	<h4>Explanation of Code</h4>

	<p>
		If you're not interested in the details, ignore this section and
		<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/api_single_page_form/step2/">go to the next step</a>. It's just for those
		of you who are curious to know what's going on!
	</p>

	<p>
		The code does a number of things. First, the <b>ft_api_init_form_page</b> function
		initializes the page environment; precisely what it does depends on the "mode", i.e. whether
		the form is in "test" mode (like now), "initialize" mode (when you put through the
		test submission to Form Tools later) or "live", when everything's been configured. But one
		thing it ALWAYS does is start PHP sessions to provide storage for the form values and
		"meta" info (like submission and form ID) as the user progresses through the form.
	</p>

	<p>
		Note that the <b>ft_api_init_form_page</b> returns a <b>$fields</b> variable. This variable
		contains all the form field values entered up to that point. So, imagine you added some
		server-side validation that threw an error after the user submitted the form. You could
		use the $fields variable to re-load all the values entered. (For more information
		on that, see the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/php_validation/">Adding
		Server-Side (PHP) Validation to your Forms</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/api_refilling_form_fields/">Re-filling
		form fields with the API</a> tutorials.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <b>ft_api_process_form</b> function is the main work-horse function: it does the job
		of adding the information to the database and redirecting, based on whatever values you
		pass to it.
	</p>

	<p>
		"Direct" form types that submit their content directly to the process.php script and have
		the submission added in on go AFTER the user had submitted the form. The API works the
		other way round. Once your form is live, the <b>ft_api_init_form_page</b> actually creates
		a blank submission BEFORE the user has even filled in a field. Then, each form submit
		will update those fields included in the form submission. Only when they are actually
		finalized (i.e. the "finalize" =&gt; true parameter is passed to ft_api_process_form) is the
		submission made visible within Form Tools. This has a number of benefits, including the
		fact that it allows you to separate your form into multiple pages, updating separate
		fields bit by bit. Also, it's compatible with adding an external mechanism to allow people
		to return later on to complete setting up their form.
