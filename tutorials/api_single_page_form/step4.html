		Finally, after your form has been added and configured via the Form Tools interface, you just need to make
		one final change to push it live. On your form page, again change the ft_api_init_form_page function line
		to this (where X is your form ID):
	</p>

	{% codemirror php %}
$fields = ft_api_init_form_page(X);
	{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		(All you did was remove the second parameter). Now, after you've revisited the "thankyou" page to ensure that
		sessions were emptied, all your form submissions should be stored in Form Tools!
	</p>
