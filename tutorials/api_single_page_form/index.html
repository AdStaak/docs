	<p>
		This tutorial explains how to integrate the Form Tools API functions to submit a single-page form. There are
		a number of benefits to using the API for single-page forms, including: the option to add server-side (PHP)
		validation and the option to display a CAPTCHA in your form using the API Recaptcha function.

	<h4>Assumptions</h4>

			after a successful submission.</li>
		<li>The pages are accessible via a web browser on a server running PHP.</li>
	</ol>
