<p>
    The next step is to configure a View:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Automatically store what Form Tools account created the submission.</li>
    <li>Set the view to <i>only show submissions for the current client account.</i></li>
</ol>

<h3>Which View?</h3>

<p>
    You can read more about <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/views/">Views here</a>, but the important things to know
    are: you can create as many Views as you want; each View can be configured differently to show different form data;
    by default, every new Form gets a new View created along with it called "All submissions".
</p>

<p>
    For this tutorial, you can edit any View you'd like - so perhaps just make these changes default All Submissions
    view. You can rename it or add more Views later once you get a better feel for it.
</p>

<h3>Editing the View</h3>

<h4>Tracking show created the submission</h4>

<p>
    Now click on the Views tab within the Edit Form pages. There, edit one of the Views (we'll pick the default
    "All Submissions" View, as shown in the screenshots).
</p>

{% include screenshot.html item="tutorial-client-map-edit-view-general-tab.png" %}

<ul>
    <li>
        On the General tab, set the <b>Access</b> field to public. This will allow all clients that have access to the form
        also have access to this particular View.
    </li>
    <li>
        Set the <b>Can add submissions</b> to <i>yes</i>.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the <b>Default Values for New Submissions</b> setting, add the field as shown in the screenshot to the right,
        namely: Field <i>Account ID</i> (the field you just created in the previous step) and default value:
        <i>{% raw %}{$ACCOUNT_ID}{% endraw %}</i>

        <div class="alert alert-info">
            <b>{% raw %}{$ACCOUNT_ID}{% endraw %}</b> is a <i>placeholder</i>. It gets replaced with the user's account ID
            when the submission is created. For a full list of placeholders, see the section on the
            <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/views/main_tab/">Default Values for New Submissions</a> field.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        Click save.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    What you've just done is configure your View to store the account ID of whatever user just created the form
    through the Form Tools interface. As mentioned before, submissions created from an external, API or Form Builder
    form won't have this value populated: it's only for submissions created within Form Tools.
</p>
