	<p>
		Make sure your form has been given a .php extension (the API requires your files to be
		PHP files - not HTML), then add the following PHP to the very top of your page with a
		few minor modifications listed underneath:
	</p>

	{% codemirror php %}
<?php
require_once("path/to/form_tools/global/api/API.class.php");
$api = new FormTools\API();
$fields = $api->initFormPage("", "test");
$params = array(
    "submit_button" => "submit_button_name_attribute",
    "next_page" => "thanks.php",
    "form_data" => $_POST,
    "file_data" => $_FILES,
    "finalize" => true
);
$api->processFormSubmission($params);
?>
	{% endcodemirror %}

	<ul>
		<li>The path to the api.php file has to be updated, depending on where it's located in
			relation to your form.</li>
		<li>Change "submit_button_name_attribute" to whatever the name attribute of your form
			submit button may be. If it doesn't have one, add it!</li>
		<li>Change "thanks.php" to whatever page you want to redirect to, after the form has been
			submitted.</li>
		<li>You can omit the "file_data" line if your form doesn't contain any file upload fields.</li>
	</ul>

	<br>

	<p>
		Next, make sure your form tag looks like this:
	</p>

	{% codemirror php %}
<form method="POST">
	{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		Because no <code>action</code> attribute is included, the form will <b>submit the information to itself</b>.
        The <code>processFormSubmission()</code> method will take care of redirecting to the next page for you. One of
        the nice things about posting the submission to itself is that if later on, you choose to add
		server-side validation (<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/php_validation/">see
		this tutorial</a>), it's very easy to handle and display the errors on the same page.
	</p>

    <p>
        If you are uploading files through your form, also include the <code>enctype</code> attribute, like so:
    </p>

    {% codemirror php %}
<form method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    {% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		With regard to the form's post attribute, if you want to use method="GET", that's fine - just change the value
        in the form method attribute to "GET" and change the PHP line in the top of the from:
	</p>

	{% codemirror php %}
"form_data" => $_POST,
	{% endcodemirror %}

	to:

	{% codemirror php %}
"form_data" => $_GET,
	{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		That lets the API know where to look for the form submission data. Finally, put through a form submission. You
        should be redirected to your "thank you" page. So far so good! Nothing is being stored in Form Tools yet, but
        we're getting there.

	<h3>Explanation of code</h3>

	<p>
		If you're not interested in the details, ignore this section and
		<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/api_v2_single_page_form/step2/">go to the next step</a>. It's just for those
		of you who are curious.
	</p>

	<p>
		The code does a number of things. First, the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/api/v2/init_form_page">initFormPage()</a>
        function initializes the page environment; precisely what it does depends on the "mode", i.e. whether the form
        is in "test" mode (like now), "initialize" mode (when you put through the test submission to Form Tools later)
        or "live", when everything's been configured. But one thing it ALWAYS does is start PHP sessions to provide
        storage for the form values and "meta" info (like submission and form ID) as the user progresses through the
        form.
	</p>

	<p>
		Note that the <code>initFormPage()</code> method returns a <code>$fields</code> variable. This variable contains all the
        form field values entered up to that point. So, imagine you added some server-side validation that threw an
        error after the user submitted the form. You could use the <code>$fields</code> variable to reload all the
        values entered. (For more information on that, see the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/php_validation/">Adding
		Server-Side (PHP) Validation to your Forms</a> and
        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/api_v2_refilling_form_fields/">Re-filling form fields with the API</a>
        tutorials.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/api/v2/process_form_submission/">processFormSubmission()</a> function is the main
        workhorse function: it does the job of adding the information to the database and redirecting, based on whatever
        values you pass to it.
	</p>

	<p>
		"Direct" form types that submit their content directly to the process.php script and have the submission added
        in on go AFTER the user had submitted the form. The API works the other way round. Once your form is live, the
        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/api/v2/init_form_page/">initFormPage()</a> actually creates a blank submission BEFORE
        the user has even filled in a field. Then, each form submit will update those fields included in the form
        submission. Only when they are actually finalized (i.e. the "finalize" =&gt; true parameter is passed to
        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/api/v2/process_form_submission/">processFormSubmission()</a>) is the submission made
        visible within Form Tools. This has a number of benefits, including the fact that it allows you to separate your
        form into multiple pages, updating separate fields bit by bit. Also, it's compatible with adding an external
        mechanism to allow people to return later on to complete setting up their form.
