	<p>
		This bit's easy. At the top of your thank you page (again, don't forget it has to be a PHP file), add the
        following code:
	</p>

	{% codemirror php %}
<?php
require_once("path/to/global/api/API.class.php");
$api = new FormTools\API();
$fields = $api->initFormPage();
$api->clearFormSessions();
?>
	{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		Don't forget to update the path to the API file, just like with your form page.
	</p>

	<hr size="1" />
	<h3>Explanation of Code</h3>

	<p>
		This code does two things. It returns all form values entered by the user in the $fields variable which you can
        to display information in the page, if you need. It also clears sessions. The API stores information
        supplied by the users in a temporary PHP/Database storage known as "sessions" so that the information isn't
        lost as they navigate from page to page. To ensure that the next time the user returns to the form they don't see
		the old information, this page empties the sessions.
	</p>

    <p class="alert alert-info">
        Note: it's VERY important while you're setting up your form that sessions are cleared. Otherwise, the test
        values won't overridden and you'll never be able to finish setting up your form!
    </p>
