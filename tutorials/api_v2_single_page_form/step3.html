	<p>
		At this point, you've done most of the work. Now you just need to put through a test submission so that
		Form Tools knows what form content to store.
	</p>

	<ol>
        <li>Log into Form Tools (as the administrator) and go to the Add Form page</li>
        <li>Select the "External" form type</li>
        <li>Select the "Code" option</li>
        <li>On te step 2 "Form Information" page, enter all the information. This is not a multi-page form, so that
            value can be set to "no".</li>
        <li>Continue to the "Text submission" step 3. There, it will have generated a line of PHP which looks like
            the following (X will be your form number)</li>
	</ol>

	{% codemirror php %}
$fields = $api->initFormPage(65, "initialize");
	{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		Copy that line and overwrite the corresponding line in your form page (the first page, not the thankyou page).
	</p>

	<p>
		{% include screenshot.html item='i98.jpg' %}
		After saving, go to your "thankyou" page in your browser to ensure that sessions have been cleared, then go
        back to your form. Here, fill in <b>every</b> field in your form and click submit. You should see something
        like the screenshot to the right.
	</p>

	<p>
		Return to Form Tools, click the "refresh page" button at the bottom of the page, then
		click "Next Step Â»" to continue adding your form.
	</p>
