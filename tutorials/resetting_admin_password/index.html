<p>
    You may find yourself in the sticky position where you've forgotten your administrator
    password. Ordinarily, you can just request the password to be sent to you via the "Forgot
    Password" link on the Form Tools login page, but if for whatever reason your email
    configuration isn't set up properly, you're rather stuck!
</p>

<p>
    This short, one-page tutorial explains how to manually re-set your administrator password.
</p>


<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>
    Access to your database via a tool like phpMyAdmin, or something like it. If you don't
    have this, you will need to contact your hosting provider to ask them for access.
</p>

<h3>Resetting the password</h3>

<p>
    All passwords are encrypted in the database, so you can't just update the database record
    with the new one. First, you need to encrypt it.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Go here: <a href="https://formtools.org/password_reset.php">https://formtools.org/password_reset.php</a></li>
    <li>
        On that page, enter your new password and submit the form. Copy and paste the encrypted
        password to your clipboard.
    </li>
    <li>
        Now access your database via phpMyAdmin and locate the <b>ft_accounts</b> table. The
        actual name of your table will depend on the database table prefix you chose when
        first installing it, but the default is <b>ft_</b>. If you're not sure, take a look
        at your <b>/global/config.php</b> file and the <b>$g_table_prefix</b> setting.
    </li>
    <li>
        View the contents of the table and look at the very first row (account_id = 1). Edit
        the record and for the <b>password</b> column, paste the encrypted password into the
        field and save.
    </li>
    <li>
        Now try logging into Form Tools. All should be well! If not,
        double-check that when you copied the password, it didn't tack on an extra space at the
        end. Browsers / OSs can do that, occasionally.
    </li>
</ol>
