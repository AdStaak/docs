	<p>
		Before starting work on adding the validation rules, we first need to include the library
		in your webpage. Since Form Tools already has it bundled with its own files, you just need
		to locate it and point to it on your server. You can find the file at this location:
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>[form tools root]/global/scripts/rsv.js</b>
	</p>

	<p>
		The "[form tools root]" is the folder of wherever you installed Form Tools.
	</p>

	<p>
		You can include the file by either a "relative" or "absolute" link. A relative link is linking
		to something <i>in respect to the location of the current file</i>. So, if you were to move
		your files around, you would need to update the relative links each time. An absolute link
		would be the full URL to the file. This would never change, regardless of what file is
		doing the including. Here's an example of both:
	</p>

{% highlight html %}
<!-- RELATIVE. this goes two folders up, then down into the global/scripts folder -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="../../global/scripts/rsv.js"></script>

<!-- ABSOLUTE -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.yoursite.com/formtools/global/scripts/rsv.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

	<p>
		You'll need to add one of those lines - with the paths adjusted for your own file locations
		on your server in the top of your webpage, in between the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;/head&gt;
		tags.
	</p>
