	<p>
		Form Tools is organized into the following structural components: the Form Tools Core code (the "Core"),
		Modules, Themes, the API and separate language files. The default theme is included as part of the Core. It
		is <b>always</b> up to date. The default theme contains the pages for the visual presentation and generation
		of all Form Tools content.
	</p>

	<div class="alert alert-danger">
		<strong>Warning!</strong> You should NEVER delete this theme. Don't delete this theme. Don't delete this
		theme. I'm serious. Deleting this theme would be like cutting off Form Tools legs, and that would make
		Form Tools sad.
	</div>

	<p>
		If you <b>do</b> delete the theme (and let's face, somebody will) you're going to
		encounter problems. But don't panic, all is not lost: re-download Form Tools and
		upload the <b>/themes/default</b> folder to your server at the appropriate spot in
		your Form Tools installation.
	</p>

	<p>
		As mentioned, the default theme contains all pages needed to display Form Tools pages
		and content. This makes it unique: all other themes don't need to do this. Other themes
		work by <b>overriding files in the default theme</b>. In other words, as a theme developer
		all you need to do is override those files that you need. This keeps your themes as simple
		as can be.
