	<p>
		Every theme has its own <b>/about folder</b> (<b>/themes/my_module/about/</b>) containing
		various "meta" information to allow it to be imported and accessible within Form Tools.
		This folder should contain three files:
	</p>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-3">
			<strong>theme.php</strong>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-9">
			This file contains information about the theme, to pass to Form Tools. Here's an example
			of this file:

			{% codemirror php %}
<?php
/**
 * Form Tools Theme File
 */

$theme_name = "Default";
$theme_author = "Form Tools";
$theme_author_email = "ben.keen@gmail.com";
$theme_link = "https://themes.formtools.org";
$theme_description = "The default Form Tools theme.";
$theme_version = "1.0.0";
$supports_ft_versions = "2.0.0";
?>
			{% endcodemirror %}

			All fields except <b>$theme_author_email</b> and <b>$theme_link</b> are required. The
			<b>$supports_ft_versions</b> fields should contain a comma-delimited list of versions
			that this theme supports.
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-3">
			<strong>screenshot.gif</strong>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-9">
			A screenshot of any page in your theme, which you feel gives the user the best sense
			of how your theme looks. This can be any size, but we recommend keeping it within a
			1000px width so that it'll fit within most screens. This image and the following
			thumbnail appear in the Settings Â» Themes page, letting the administrator see
			all themes at a glance.
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-3">
			<strong>thumbnail.gif</strong>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-9">
			A thumbnail of your screenshot. To ensure consistency within the Form Tools UI,
			<b>this thumbnail should have a width of 200px</b>.
		</div>
	</div>
