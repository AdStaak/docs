<p>
  This simple module lets you modify or reset the submission IDs for your forms. Note you can only reset the
  submission ID count for empty forms, and you cannot change the submission ID count to a number lower than the
  highest current submission ID. The module lets you change the start number, so the submission ID would start at
  10,000, for example.
