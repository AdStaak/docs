  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p class="alert alert-info">
    <b>Warning!</b> This module requires technical knowledge of PHP, Smarty templating or in the very least HTML.
  </p>

  <h4>So what does this module do?</h4>

  <p>
    The Hooks Manager module provides you with a simple interface to add your own code or
    HTML/Smarty markup allowing it to appear in Form Tools pages, or have it executed at
    particular junctures in the code. What code you choose to add depends entirely on your
    needs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Form Tools has dozens and dozens of "hooks" littered throughout the code and within
    the Smarty templates used to generate the visible webpages. These allow
    developers like yourself to develop modules that extend the core functionality and
    display extra information in the UI.
  </p>

  <p>
    Like to add new fields to any of the Form Tools pages? Like to send emails to notify
    yourselves when specific users change specific values in the form submissions? Like
    to know when users are exporting data? No problem! All of this - and far, far more,
    can be done relatively simply by using this module. To give you another idea, from a
    technical standpoint the entire functionality offered by the Submission Pre-Parser
    and Extended Client Fields modules could be emulated using the Hooks Manager. They
    were implemented as separate modules since they're easier to handle that way.
  </p>

  <h4>Hooks Manager vs. custom modules</h4>

  <p>
    <b>This module adds nothing that can't be done via a custom module</b>. But writing a
    separate module can be a bit of an uphill struggle: it requires learning about how
    the Form Tools module system works which can take time. Plus, often you don't
    need a UI for whatever it is you're doing: sometimes you just want something simpler;
    sometimes you don't need a pretty UI to allow people to use and configure it.
  </p>

  <p>
    The basic difference is that for larger functionality - functionality that requires
    an interface for configuring its behaviour, you should run the gauntlet and
    learning about how modules work. But for OTHER uses, the Hooks Manager may well be
    a better fit.
  </p>

  <p>
    To help you understand what this module can do, I'll provide a lot of examples
    in this documentation. They should give you a clue of two things: how powerful it
    is, and what kind of things it can do.
  </p>

  <p>
    We'll start with a simple examination of the Hooks Manager UI: how you can utilize it
    to solve your problem.
