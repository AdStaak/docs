  <p>
    The Hooks Manager works around the concept of "rules" (borrowed from its predecessor, the
    <a href="/modules/submission_pre_parser/">Submission Pre-Parser</a> module). You can define as many rules as you
    want: each rule typically doing a single task. A rule is associated with one (and only one) hook.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can create rules to be attached to code hooks, template hooks, and "custom" hooks (which are actually just
    template hooks, but whose names are entirely up to you. Here's what they each mean.
  </p>

  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1" width="100%">
    <tbody><tr>
      <td width="140" valign="top"><a href="../code_hooks">Code hooks</a></td>
      <td>
        Code hooks are events in the code which you can attach you own PHP code. There
        are dozens and dozens of available code hooks for things like updating submissions,
        sending emails and logging in.

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><a href="../template_hooks">Template hooks</a></td>
      <td>
        These are places in the actual webpages where you can insert your own HTML markup. For example, the
        <a href="/modules/extended_client_fields/">Extended Client Fields</a> module uses template hooks to insert
        extra fields for client accounts so you can store whatever you want. The Hooks Manager lets you do the same
        thing, except that it allows you to insert code for ANY template hook (found on many pages in the Form Tools UI).
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><a href="../custom_hooks">Custom hooks</a></td>
      <td>
        Custom hooks are special, custom-defined template hooks. While the number and location
        of Form Tools template hooks is static (me, the core developer adds them), you can
        create as many custom hooks as you want. You can then use these hooks elsewhere in the
        program to display your markup. For example, the (upcoming release) of the Pages module
        lets you embed your custom hooks into a page to allow for whatever dynamic content
        you want.
