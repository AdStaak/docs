  <h3>Tracking "last emailed date" for submissions</h3>

  <p>
    For this example, we're going to expand the core functionality of the Form Tools script by keeping track of the
    last time each submission was emailed. This can be helpful for adminstrative purposes - knowing when a user was last
    contacted.
  </p>
  <p>
    This example has three steps:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li><a href="../new_db_field">Add a new "last emailed" form field</a></li>
    <li><a href="../update_view">Update your View(s)</a></li>
    <li><a href="../create_hook">Creating the hook</a></li>
  </ol>
