  <h3>For Developers</h3>

  <p>
    If you're a module developer working on a module that uses one more tables, you'll probably
    want to make your module compatible with this one. I've personally found it a really
    invaluable tool for quickly eliminating the DB structure as the source of issues. The
    module works really, really simply. It works by taking a snapshot of a valid database
    and generates a PHP array containing the database table and column info. For testing,
    it then compares the actual DB structure with the content in that file.
  </p>

  <p>
    Take a look at the <b>dbi_generate_db_config_file</b> - this generates a PHP file for your
    tables. What's probably simplest is just to edit the /database_integrity/index.php file
    and uncomment the lines labeled "module table generation". Be sure to feed in the names of
    your tables to that function. Then load the module in your browser: that will output the
    content for your own custom database_integrity.php file (to be placed in your module root
    folder).
