  <p>
    This module replaces the older <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/database_integrity/">Database
    Integrity module</a>. It offers a few simple, quick tests to run on your
    Form Tools installation: kind of like taking your car to get it serviced
    - except this is free!
  </p>

  <h3>The tests</h3>

  <p>
    The module currently offers four tests:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b><a href="file_verification/">File Verification</a></b> - this
      examines the <b>Core</b>, <b>modules</b> and <b>themes</b> to check that all the files
      have been uploaded properly to your site.</li>
    <li><b><a href="table_verification/">Table Verification</a></b> - this
      examines the structure of your <b>Core</b> and <b>module</b> tables.</li>
    <li><b><a href="hook_verification/">Hook Verification</a></b> - this
      checks to make sure the <b>module</b> hooks are all correct.</li>
    <li><b><a href="orphans/">Orphan Clean-up</a></b> - this
      identifies and removes old, dud database records and references.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Compatibility</h3>

  <p>
    The System Check was designed to be compatible with the old Database Integrity module,
    so you can simply install this module and run the same tests as offered by the older
    module. However, the <a href="file_verification/">File Verification</a> test is
    newer: you will need to upgrade your modules and themes to be able to run those tests.
