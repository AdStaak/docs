    You shouldn't ever see any problems, but despite our best efforts, <i>bugs do happen</i>.
    We'll maintain this list depending on what's reported in the forums.

  <div class="alert alert-success">
    FORM TOOLS CORE - ft_hook_calls - Invalid column: action_location<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- is: enum('start','end')<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- should be: varchar(100)
  </div>

  <b>Severity</b>

  <p>
    <span class="red bold">HIGH</span>. This error will prevent most modules from
    functioning properly: you should fix it right away.
  </p>

  <b>Explanation</b>

  <p>
    In an early 2.0.0 Beta version, the <b>action_location</b> column of the
    <b>[prefix]hook_calls</b> Core table only permitted two values: "start" and "end".
    We changed that to a varchar before the final 2.0.0 release to allow for more
    flexibility. However, it appears that the old setting slipped back into a later
    version of the Core at some point, because we've had this reported a number of
    times.
  </p>

  <b>Solution</b>

  <ol>
    <li>Through phpMyAdmin, run the following SQL query on your database (you
      will need to change %%prefix%% with whatever database prefix your tables are using):

      <blockquote><pre>ALTER TABLE %%prefix%%hook_calls CHANGE action_location action_location
VARCHAR(100) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NOT NULL;
</pre></blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>Return to the Database Integrity and run the
      <a href="table_verification/">Table Verification</a> test again. The error should
      now be gone.</li>
    <li>
      Now run the
      <a href="hook_verification/">Hook Verification</a> test again. If it finds any
      errors, just use the auto-repair option to fix them.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <div class="alert alert-success">
    Export Manager - ft_module_export_groups - missing column: form_view_mapping<br>
    <br>
    Export Manager - ft_module_export_groups - missing column: forms_and_views
  </div>

  <b>Severity</b>

  <p>
    <span class="blue bold">LOW</span>. This error will prevent the
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/export_manager/">Export Manager</a> module from working
    properly, but there should be no other side-effects.
  </p>

  <b>Explanation</b>

  <p>
    This was due to a problem with how modules are upgraded. The problem was in the Core;
    it will be fixed in 2.1.5.
  </p>

  <b>Solution</b>

  <p>
    You have two options.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Uninstall then re-install the module. However, if you've customized anything
      within the module, those customizations will be lost.</li>
    <li>Run the following queries on your database (replacing %%prefix%% with your
      table prefix):

      <blockquote><pre>ALTER TABLE %%prefix%%module_export_groups
ADD form_view_mapping ENUM('all', 'except', 'only')
NOT NULL DEFAULT 'all' AFTER access_type;

ALTER TABLE %%prefix%%module_export_groups
ADD forms_and_views MEDIUMTEXT NULL AFTER form_view_mapping;
</pre><blockquote</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Lastly, run the "Hook Verification" test in the Database Integrity module and
    tell it to repair any problems it finds.</p>
