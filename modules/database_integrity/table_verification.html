  <p>
    The first test you can run is called <b>Table Verification</b>. This works by
    checking your <b>actual</b> Form Tools database structure with what it
    <b>should</b> be. It then generates a log of all successfully tested elements (tables
    and columns), and provides a list of elements that failed. These errors include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Missing tables</li>
    <li>Missing table columns</li>
    <li>Invalid table columns: contain the wrong information</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>How to use</h4>
  <p>
    This test is exceedingly easy to use. Just install the module as usual (see <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/modules/installing"
      target="_blank">instructions here</a>), then go to your Modules page and select it. Once in the module,
    you'll see a list of components that have provided information about their database structure. Select those
    components you want to test (all are selected by default) and click the Test button. That will generate success
    and error logs of what it finds.
  </p>


  <h4>What it DOESN'T test</h4>

  <p>
    This module currently only tests the database structure. It doesn't test the semantic content of the tables;
    i.e. it doesn't confirm that the tables contain the data that's expected. Likewise, it doesn't test your custom
    form tables to confirm that the fields and data in those tables match the data stored in your main forms table.
  </p>

  <h4>Found Problems?</h4>

  <p>
    Don't panic! This is a good thing! I mean, sure, <i>ideally</i> there would be no
    problems, but now at least we now know what could be leading to
    any number problems with your installation.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the module finds a problem with your tables, first check the <a href=common_problems/">Common Problems</a> page.
    If you don't find your problem listed there, you'll need to post your error logs in the forums. The Table
    Verification test only <i>identifies</i> problems - not fixes them. This is by design: we want to know what problems
    people are running into so we can figure out what happened and find patterns in the problems. But also, we don't
    want to execute potentially harmful "fixes" to your database without fully understanding them first.
  </p>

  <p>
    After you post in the forums, we'll respond with instructions on how to proceed.
    This will include these steps:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Using phpMyAdmin or another database access tool, back up the database tables that are affected.</li>
    <li>Again, using phpMyAdmin, run the SQL that we will supply.</li>
  </ol>
