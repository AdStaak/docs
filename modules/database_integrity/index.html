  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    This module is now deprecated. If you're running 2.1.5 or later of the Form Tools
    Core, use the <b><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/system_check/">System Check</a></b>
    module instead.
  </div>

  <p>
    This module was written to help debug problems that arise with Form Tools. The
    module provides you with a couple of quick, simple tests to run on your
    database. This is well, well worth doing: in the very least to confirm that the
    problems you're encountering are not due to a corrupt database.
  </p>

  <h3>The tests</h3>

  <p>
    The module offers two tests:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b><a href="table_verification/">Table Verification</a></b> - this
      examines the structure of your Core and module tables.</li>
    <li><b><a href="hook_verification/">Hook Verification</a></b> - this
      checks to make sure the module hooks are all correct.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How could a database get corrupted?</h3>

  <p>
    This can happen in a number of different ways, but the most likely causes are:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Problems with upgrading. This can occur if the SQL updates in the upgrade script
      fail to run properly, either to a bug in the code or a problem with the content that
      was FTP'd to your server.</li>
    <li>If someone manually edited your database.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Compatibility</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>This module supports all final releases of the Form Tools Core (at the time of
      writing: 2.0.0-2.0.6, 2.1.0-2.1.4).</li>
    <li>It <b>will not work</b> with early beta releases.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Any modules that have custom database tables may also use this module to test their
    database integrity. I will be adding support for this module to all relevant modules.
