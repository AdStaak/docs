  <p>
    The Pages module lets you create custom pages to embed within the Form Tools UI, containing
    whatever information you want. A common usage for this module is to provide some sort of
    custom "Splash" screen for client accounts when they log in, which contains simple
    help information.
  </p>

  <p>
    With version <b>1.1.0</b> of this module, we added some more advanced functionality so
    you can really utilize this script to good effect. Now you can do things like:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>embed HTML, PHP or Smarty content</li>
    <li>use Form Tools' built in Smarty functions to display form and submission data directly
      within your pages</li>
    <li>set the permissions on the page so that only a particular user account can access it
      (this was possible prior to version 1.1.0, but it wasn't secure)</li>
  </ul>

{% include close_section.html %}
