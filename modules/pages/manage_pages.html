  <h3>Adding / Editing Pages</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i49.jpg" %}

  <p>
    Here's what the various fields mean on the add and edit field pages. Most of it's
    pretty self-explanatory, but there's a few things that you can still learn.
  </p>

  <table width="100%">
    <tbody><tr>
      <th width="120">Field</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Page Name</td>
      <td>
        This value is used internally to help you identify the page and as the menu
        item label.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Page Heading</td>
      <td>
        This is the heading that appears on the page.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Content Type</td>
      <td>
        PHP, HTML or Smarty. This determines what kind of content type you enter into the
        page. HTML is the simplest, but PHP and Smarty give you far more control over the
        content of the page, as well as giving you access to the database and anything
        else server-side.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Page Content</td>
      <td>
        The actual page content.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Who can access?</td>
      <td>
        This provides a secure way to protect the page from being accessed by anyone in
        particular. However, as the comment notes: pages still need to be assigned to a
        client via their menu or a hardcoded link in order to be seen. This setting is for
        security purposes only.
      </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
