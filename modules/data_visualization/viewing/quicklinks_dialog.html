  <h3>The Quicklinks Dialog</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i300.gif" %}

  <p>
    As mentioned on the previous page, the quicklinks dialog is the primary way to view
    your visualizations. After your form contains one or more visualizations, you'll see
    a new icon appear in the quicklinks bar at the top right of the Submission Listing page.
    See the screenshot to the right: see the pie chart icon? That's the one! When you click
    it, a dialog window will appear that automatically loads all the visualizations.
  </p>

  <p>
    There's actually a great deal of functionality stashed away in the dialog, so lets
    dissect it bit by bit.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="#nav">Navigation</a></li>
    <li><a href="#buttons">Admin Buttons (easy management!)</a></li>
    <li><a href="#cache">Refreshing the Cache</a></li>
    <li><a href="#size">Dialog Size and Thumb Sizes</a></li>
    <li><a href="#other">Other Stuff</a></li>
  </ul>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i285.gif" %}

  <a name="nav"></a>
  <h4>Navigation</h4>
  <p>
    If you only have a single visualization, when the dialog window opens it will
    automatically render the visualization as full size: you won't see any unnecessary
    navigation. But otherwise, the dialog will automatically tile all the visualizations.
  </p>
  <p>
    To see any of the tiled visualizations in full screen, click the icon at the top right
    of the tile. As soon as you do that, you'll see some navigation appear at the bottom
    left: « prev, back to visualization list, and next ». Clicking each takes
    you to the appropriate page.
  </p>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i280.gif" %}

  <p>
    This is a nice simple way to get around. As mentioned elsewhere, feel free to re-size
    the dialog if you want to see the visualization in a larger format.
  </p>

  <a name="buttons"></a>
  <h4>Admin Buttons (easy management!)</h4>
  <p>
    Depending on who is viewing the dialog (admin or client) and where (Submission Listing
    page or on the Manage Visualizations page), the buttons will will change. For the
    administrator on the Submission Listing page, they'll see a "Manage Visualizations"
    button which, when clicked, redirects them to the module visualization list page - and
    it automatically tailors the list for visualizations in that particular form.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a terrific way to quickly manage that subset of your visualizations.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the adminstrator selects a particular visualization in the quicklinks dialog so
    they are viewing it full screen, the button changes to "Edit Visualization". As you'd
    expect, when you click that, it takes you to the appropriate Edit Visualization page
    in the module where you can tweak the values. Again, this cuts down the time to locate
    and tweak each visualization.
  </p>
  <a name="cache"></a>
  <h4>Refreshing the Cache</h4>

  <p>
    Caching is really important in order to display the visualizations reasonably quickly,
    however, it can lead to confusing results if you forget the data's been cached! So,
    when viewing a visualization full screen in the quicklinks dialog, at the bottom
    right of the dialog window it lists the last cache time. For administrators (and
    clients, if they have been permitted to do so on the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/data_visualization/admin/main_settings">Main
    Settings</a> page), a small "Refresh" icon will appear to the right of it. Form Tools
    users can just click that icon to request the cache be re-updated on the fly.
  </p>

  <a name="size"></a>
  <h4>Dialog size and thumb sizes</h4>

  <p>
    You may change the default sizes to whatever you want. Just go to the Module's "Main
    Settings" page. There, change the "Quicklinks dialog default dimensions" and
    "Visualization thumb size" values. For more information on that, see the
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/data_visualization/admin/main_settings">Main Settings</a> page.
  </p>

  <a name="other"></a>
  <h4>Other Stuff</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Charts look different whether they are small or large. If there's too much information
      to display in a tiny thumbnail, Google Charts will do it's best to only show the
      pertinent info. Be warned!</li>
    <li>Even though the data is cached for each visualization, the quicklinks dialog
      still may take a little time to load: if you have dozens of visualizations which are
      loading large data sets, this can take time! Also, Google Charts does a great deal of
      work when actually rendering the charts.</li>
  </ul>
