  <h3>Viewing your visualizations</h3>

  <p>
    You can view your visualizations in three different ways. The table below summarizes
    them and the next three pages explain them in more detail.
  </p>

  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1" class="info">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" width="190">
        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/data_visualization/viewing/quicklinks_dialog">The Quicklinks Dialog</a>
      </td>
      <td valign="top">
        The quicklinks dialog is found on your form submissions page. There, after you've created
        one or more visualizations for your form (and it has permissions to show up), you'll
        see a new pie chart icon in the "quicklinks" bar, appearing at the top right of the
        Submissions table. Clicking it will open up quicklinks dialog containing all the
        visualizations.
      </td>
      <td valign="top">{% include screenshot.html item="i299.gif" %}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/data_visualization/viewing/pages_module">Through the Pages module</a></td>
      <td valign="top">
        The <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/pages/">Pages module</a> lets you create
        any number of pages to link to within the Form Tools UI. The Data Visualization
        module directly interacts with that module to automatically create pages containing
        your visualizations and assign them to your menus.
      </td>
      <td>{% include screenshot.html item="i295.gif" %}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/data_visualization/viewing/external_pages">In your own pages</a></td>
      <td valign="top" colspan="2">
        Lastly, you're welcome to use your visualizations in your own webpages. This
        is terrific for publicly displaying summaries of your form data. What's best is
        that you don't need any programming knowledge! Just copy and paste the generated
        PHP into your own PHP pages to display the visualization. Changing the size is
        as simple as changing a couple of values so you can re-use the same visualization
        multiple times, each showing it in different sizes.
