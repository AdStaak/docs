  <h3>Showing visualizations in your own pages</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i289.gif" %}

  <p>
    The final way to display your visualizations is to display them directly in your own
    website pages, outside of Form Tools.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's actually very simple. Edit the visualization that you're interested in and go to the
    "Advanced" tab. There, copy and paste the PHP that's generated in the section at the
    bottom into your own PHP pages. Note: the pages must be on the same server as your
    Form Tools installation. It will not work otherwise.
  </p>

  <h4>Changing the Visualization Size</h4>

  <p>
    You can change the size of the visualization by simply changing the values of the
    <b>$height</b> and <b>$width</b> variables.
