  <h3>Default Settings</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i277.gif" %}

  <p>
    In the left module's navigation, you'll see a submenu item under "Main Settings" labeled
    "Activity Charts". That page lets you choose your default settings for this visualization
    type. Depending on the forms and data set you're working with, this page can help cut
    down on the configuration time needed to set up a new Activity Chart.
  </p>

  <p>
    The screenshot to the right shows a typical set of default settings. The page
    contains two example visualizations: a thumbnail-sized one (which gives you an idea of
    what it will look like in the <a href="/modules/data_visualization/viewing/quicklinks_dialog">Quicklinks Dialog</a>)
    and a larger, full-size visualization. The actual data being graphed on this pages is just dummy data.
    Try changing some of the settings: the visualizations in the page will automatically update
    to reflect your settings. This is a nice, visual way to choose your settings - so you know
    what you're actually getting!
  </p>

  <p class="alert alert-info">
    Google Charts does its best to display the data in as clear a manner as possible,
    so, when creating smaller visualizations it may reduce the total amount of information
    shown (such as the number of columns, rows or labels). Once you start creating your
    own visualizations, you'll find that you'll get a sense of this and construct them
    accordingly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here's what each of the settings on this page mean.
  </p>

  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td width="200" valign="top">Date Range to display</td>
    <td>
      This determines the time period to include in the graph. There are a lot of options,
      but bear in mind that the larger the duration, the slower the visualization will
      take to load.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">Group submission count by</td>
    <td>
      This lets you group together the activity county by day or month. If you've selected
      a short period to graph (e.g. the last week), it wouldn't make sense to choose
      "month" here. Likewise, if you chose to display a year or more, you wouldn't want
      to select "week" in this field.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="blue" valign="top">Chart Type</td>
    <td>
      Activity Charts can be displayed as Line Charts, Area Charts or Column Charts. Click
      on each on to see what they look like. The <a href="../chart_types">next
      page</a> also shows each one.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="blue" valign="top">Colour</td>
    <td>
      This controls the default colour of all Activity Charts.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="blue" valign="top">Line Width</td>
    <td>
      This final setting is relevant for Line and Area Charts only: it controls how thick
      the top line is.
    </td>
  </tr>
  </tbody></table>
