  <h3>Creating a Field Chart</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i283.gif" %}

  <p>
    To create a new Field Chart, select the module from the Modules page in the Form
    Tools administrator interface and click the "Create New Visualization" button at
    the bottom of the page. That will open up a dialog window that looks something
    like the screenshot to the right. Mouseover the second column - Field Charts - and
    click.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Add Field Chart page looks something like the second screenshot on this page. As
    with the other configuration pages, the page shows two visualizations - thumbnail
    and full size - which get updated as you fill in the page. Here's what each of
    the fields mean.
  </p>

  <h4>Main Settings</h4>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i303.gif" %}

  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1" class="info">
    <tbody><tr>
      <td width="140" class="blue" valign="top">Visualization Name</td>
      <td>The unique name of this visualization, used to describe what it's about.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Form</td>
      <td>The form that contains the field you're interested in visualizing.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">View</td>
      <td>
        The form View. After you select this option, the fields dropdown will be populated with
        all the fields in the selected View.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Field</td>
      <td>
        The field you're interested in visualizing. As mentioned elsewhere, Field Charts
        generally work best on fields that are assigned to Option Lists - i.e. dropdowns,
        radios and checkboxes.
      </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody></table>

  <h4>Appearance</h4>

  <p>
    This section is where you can customize the look and feel of the visualization.
  </p>

  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1" class="info">
    <tbody><tr>
      <td width="160" class="blue" valign="top">Chart Type</td>
      <td>The type of chart. Try selecting different ones to see how they look.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Ignore fields with empty values</td>
      <td>
        This setting is important to produce quality charts. If the form fields you're
        visualizing isn't required, the likelihood is that it contains any number of empty
        values. Graphing empty values can throw off the chart, so this setting lets you
        rectify it.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Colour</td>
      <td>
        This is for Bar and Column charts only. It determines the colour of the bars / columns.
      </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody></table>

  <h4>Pie Chart Settings</h4>

  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1&quot;" class="info" width="100%">
    <tbody><tr>
      <td width="160" class="blue" valign="top">Pie Chart Format</td>
      <td>Whether you want a 2D or 3D pie chart.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Include legend in thumbnail</td>
      <td>
        This setting controls whether the small thumbnail version of the visualization
        which appears in the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/data_visualization/viewing/quicklinks_dialog">Quicklinks Dialog</a> should
        contain a legend or not. Generally, you probably won't want to include it, because
        there isn't enough space. However, if you've increased the size of the thumbnail
        on the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/data_visualization/admin/main_settings">Main Settings</a> page, you may wish to include the
        legend.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Include legend in full size</td>
      <td>
        This determines whether or no the full size thumbnail contains the legend or not. The
        full size visualization is what you see in the
        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/data_visualization/viewing/quicklinks_dialog">Quicklinks Dialog</a> after clicking on a particular
        visualization. It also controls the presence of the legend in visualizations loaded
        through the Pages module and in pages loaded in your own pages.
      </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
