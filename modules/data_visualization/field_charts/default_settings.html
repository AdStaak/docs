  <h3>Default Settings</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i284.gif" %}

  <p>
    The "Field Chart" link in the module navigation (found as a submenu under "Main
    Settings") controls the default settings for all Field Charts you create through the
    module. If you need to create a lot of similar Field Charts, this page can help cut
    down on configuration time.
  </p>

  <p>
    As with other pages in the module, as you change the content on the page, the example
    visualizations are automatically updated to reflect your selections. The two
    visualizations on the page contain dud data, just to give you a sense of how the
    "real" visualizations will look.
  </p>

  <h4>Appearance</h4>

  <p>
    This section is where you can customize the look and feel of the visualization.
  </p>

  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1">
    <tbody><tr>
      <td width="160" class="blue" valign="top">Chart Type</td>
      <td>The type of chart. Try selecting different ones to see how they look.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Ignore fields with empty values</td>
      <td>
        This setting is important to produce quality charts. If the form fields you're
        visualizing isn't required, the likelihood is that it contains any number of empty
        values. Graphing empty values can throw off the chart, so this setting lets you
        rectify it.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Colour</td>
      <td>
        This is for Bar and Column charts only. It determines the colour of the bars / columns.
      </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h4>Pie Chart Settings</h4>

  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1" class="info" width="100%">
    <tbody><tr>
      <td width="160" class="blue" valign="top">Pie Chart Format</td>
      <td>Whether you want a 2D or 3D pie chart.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Include legend in thumbnail</td>
      <td>
        This setting controls whether the small thumbnail version of the visualization
        which appears in the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/data_visualization/viewing/quicklinks_dialog">Quicklinks Dialog</a> should
        contain a legend or not. Generally, you probably won't want to include it, because
        there isn't enough space. However, if you've increased the size of the thumbnail
        on the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/data_visualization/admin/main_settings">Main Settings</a> page, you may wish to include the
        legend.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Include legend in full size</td>
      <td>
        This determines whether or no the full size thumbnail contains the legend or not. The
        full size visualization is what you see in the
        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/data_visualization/viewing/quicklinks_dialog">Quicklinks Dialog</a> after clicking on a particular
        visualization. It also controls the presence of the legend in visualizations loaded
        through the Pages module and in pages loaded in your own pages.
      </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody></table>
