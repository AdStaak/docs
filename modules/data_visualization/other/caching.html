  <h3>Caching and Load Times</h3>

  <p>
    So... caching! Caching is both your best and worst friend - that's right: it's
    your <b>frenemy</b>. It can vastly improve speed but also lead to a great deal
    of confusion when things don't appear to be updating. With that in mind, we were
    extremely careful when designing the caching component. Whenever viewing the
    visualizations through the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/data_visualization/viewing/quicklinks_dialog">Quicklinks dialog</a>,
    the last cached time is shown (or "Not cached" if you've disabled the cache for
    the visualization).
  </p>

  <h4>Why cache?</h4>

  <p>
    So here's the problem in a nutshell. Imagine your form contains a very large
    data set: thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of records. When you choose to
    create a visualizations on that data set, there's actually a tremendous amount of
    work involved with rendering it: the database query takes a
    long time to process, and the volume of information passed from the server to the
    client can be excessively large. Caching can significantly speed this up. Instead of
    re-running the same long-running query multiple times, it performs it once and caches
    the result. Then for a set duration, all subsequent queries pull the information
    from the cache instead of re-running the query.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every visualization you create through the module has a cache frequency. If you choose,
    you can set it not to cache at all - but you should only use that when speed
  </p>

  <p>
    The basic rule of thumb is to just play it by ear. If you find visualizations are
    taking a long time to load then use the cache.
  </p>

  <p>
    Google Charts (which is used to render the actual charts) may take a long time
    to display a visualization if there is a huge amount of data being passed into it. So
    although caching will improve the speed in some cases, if your visualization contains
    a lot of data (e.g. you're'graphing the activity count every day for the last 5 years),
    the visualization will still take time to load. I'm afraid this is unavoidable - so
    configure your visualizations well!
