  <h3>Main Settings</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i298.gif" %}

  <p>
    The Main Settings page contains a number of key settings for the module.
  </p>

  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1" class="info">
    <tbody><tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top" width="180">Quicklinks dialog default dimensions</td>
      <td>
        This setting lets you control the size of the Quicklinks dialog window. You can always
        resize the dialog manually, but this can be more convenient.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Visualization thumb size</td>
      <td>
        This controls the size of the tiled visualizations in the Quicklinks dialog. You
        probably don't want to make these <i>too</i> small, since the thumbnails will be
        unrecognizable!
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Default cache frequency</td>
      <td>
        The determines the default cache frequency for all newly created visualizations. You
        can always override this value for any individual visualization.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Allow clients to refresh cache</td>
      <td>
        If this is set to "yes", the client will see a small refresh icon in the Quicklinks
        dialog window for each full-screen visualization. It allows them to reload the cache
        to ensure they're always graphing the most up to date data.
      </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>
    Lastly, the "Clear Visualization Cache" button at the bottom lets you
    empty the cache for all visualizations so the next time they are loaded the caches will
    all be renewed.
