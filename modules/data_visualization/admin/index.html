  <p>
    As soon as you've created a few visualizations, you're going to find you need an easy
    way to manage them: to locate, edit and delete them. Usability was taken into account
    in all aspects of this module, so hopefully you'll find it easy to use!
  </p>

  <p>
    The main page of the module looks something like the screenshot to the right: it
    contains an advanced search bar at the top, letting you search for precisely those
    visualizations you're interested in - by form, View, account, chart types and more.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition, this page was designed to work in conjunction with the administrator's
    <a href="/modules/data_visualization/viewing/quicklinks_dialog">Quicklinks Dialog</a> so whenever you click the "Manage
    Visualizations" button on a particular form View, it will redirect you to this page and
    pre-fill the search to limit the results to only those visualizations you were just looking
    at.
  </p>
