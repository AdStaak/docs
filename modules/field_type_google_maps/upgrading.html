    <h3>Upgrading from Form Tools 2</h3>

    <p>
        Versions 2.x of this module support Form Tools 3. Along with that update, this module now uses the latest
        version of Google Maps which requires supplying a Google Maps key from Google. To do this,
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key" target="_blank">go to this
        page</a>. That will lead you through the steps to acquire an API key.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you have set it up with Google, log in as the Form Tools administrator and go to Modules &raquo; Google Maps Field.
        There, enter your API key and save.
    </p>
    <p>
        Done! Now your Google Maps fields will work as before.
