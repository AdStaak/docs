  <h3>Adding Fields</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i104.jpg" %}

  <p>
    Adding your custom fields is really very simple. After installing the module (see
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/modules/installing">explanation here</a>), select the module and click on the "Add Field" link
    in the left-hand navigation menu. You should see a page similar to the screenshot to the right (the field options
    section only appears when you select a multi-select option like radios or checkboxes).
  </p>

  <p>
    Here's what all the fields mean.
  </p>

  <table class="info" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
    <tbody><tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top" width="160">Page and Location</td>
      <td valign="top">
        This dropdown contains the five locations in the Edit Client pages (main tab and settings tab) where you can
        insert your new fields. See the <a href="../field_locations">Field Locations</a> page for a visual
        representation of the locations.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Administrator Only</td>
      <td valign="top">
        This makes the field only appear for the administrator - not the client.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Field Label</td>
      <td valign="top">
        The label for the field (e.g. "Gender", "City" or something that specifies it's meaning).
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Field Type</td>
      <td valign="top">
        The form field type: textbox, textarea, radios, checkboxes, select, multi-select, password.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Default Value</td>
      <td valign="top">
        The default value for the field. If the field is a multi-select field like a group of checkboxes or multi-select
        dropdown, you can enter multiple default values by separating them with a pipe (|) character. For example, if
        there were three options: One, Two and Three, you could set One and Three as selected/checked by default by
        entering "One|Three" into this field.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Required Field</td>
      <td valign="top">
        This line lets you add basic field validation to the field. Specifically, whether the field is required or not.
        Make sure that if you check the "Required Field?" checkbox, you enter the error message that should appear if
        the field is empty.
      </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
