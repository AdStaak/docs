  <h3>Overview</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i105.gif" %}

  <p>
    The Extended Client Fields module lets you construct any number of form fields to store
    additional information for your client accounts. The module comes with a number of nifty
    features, including:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Control whether the fields appear in the Edit Client -&gt; Main tab or -&gt; Settings tab.</li>
    <li>Control the location and order they appear in the pages.</li>
    <li>Choose whether the field should only appear for the administrator, or the client as well.</li>
    <li>Each field can be of any of the following field types: textbox, textarea, select or multi-select dropdown,
      radio buttons or checkboxes.</li>
    <li>You can define a default value for the fields.</li>
    <li>Group related field under a section header (optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The screenshot above shows a typical usage of this module. There are four new fields added
    to the Edit Client page: gender, age, city and country grouped under the title
    "Additional Info".
  </p>

  <h4>Requirements / Restrictions</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>This module requires version 2.0.0-beta-20090402 or later of the Form Tools Core. So upgrade first!</li>
    <li>There's a hidden restriction with assigning your fields to the client's Edit Account -&gt; Settings page:
      <b>the client must have at least one editable field defined on their Settings page</b>. If they don't, your
      extended client fields won't show up. This is due to the way the Core template is structured.</li>
  </ul>
