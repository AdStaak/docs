  <h3>Form Builder Error Codes</h3>

  <p>
    In case something serious goes wrong with a Form Builder-published form, it will
    output a simple error code. These shouldn't ever occur, but if they do, the following
    description should give you a little better idea of what's going on.
  </p>

  <table width="100%">
    <tbody><tr>
      <th width="120">Error Code</th>
      <th>Explanation</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue">FB100</td>
      <td>
        The form associated with this form builder form no longer exists.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue">FB101</td>
      <td>
        The View associated with this form builder form no longer exists.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue">FB102</td>
      <td>
        One of the specific Template Set templates being used by this published
        form no longer exists.
      </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
