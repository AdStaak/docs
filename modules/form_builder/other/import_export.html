  <h3>Importing and Exporting Template Sets</h3>

  <p>
    We will soon be working on a new Shared Resource module / service to allow easy
    sharing of assorted Form Tools data: form configurations, Option Lists and Form
    Builder template sets. But until that is completed, the only way to import and
    export your Template Set data is <i>manually</i>, as described below.
  </p>

  <h4>Exporting your Template Set</h4>

  <p>
    If you want to copy one of your Template Sets to another Form Tools installation, you
    need to <i>export</i> it. Here's how it works.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Log into Form Tools and go to your Modules page. There, select the Form
      Builder. The page that appears will list all of your Template Sets.</li>
    <li>Mouse-over the "edit" icon for the Template Set you want to export (but don't click
      it). You should see the URL appear in your browser status bar. Make a note of the number
      for the template set ID (the X): <b>?page=info&amp;set_id=X</b></li>
    <li>In the URL of the current page, add the following query string and click &lt;enter&gt;:
      <b>?export=X</b> (where X is the Template Set ID that you spotted in the previous step).</li>
    <li>After you click enter, youâ€™ll see some generated PHP appear inside a full-page textarea.
      Copy the generated PHP and save the file as <b>your_template_name.php</b>. You've exported
      your Template Set!</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Importing a Template Set</h4>

  <ol>
    <li>With your FTP client, upload your template set PHP file to the
      /modules/form_builder/share folder.</li>
    <li>Log into Form Tools and go to your Modules page. There, select the Form
      Builder. The page that appears will list all of your Template Sets.</li>
    <li>In the URL of the current page, add the following query string and click &lt;enter&gt;:
      <b>?import=your_template_set_filename.php</b> (replace the "your_template_set_filename.php"
      with the actual name of your file).</li>
    <li>Click &lt;enter&gt; in the browser toolbar to load the page and import your
      Template Set.</li>
  </ol>
