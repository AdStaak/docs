  <h3>Changing the default Form Builder window size</h3>

  <p>
    {% include screenshot.html item="i363.gif" %}
    When you open the Form Builder window through the Edit Form Â» Publish tab,
    the dimensions of the window may not be appropriate to your environment. Some people
    have small screens, others very large; and although you can resize the window once it's
    opened, you may just want to change the default size once and for all.
  </p>

  <p>
    To do this, log in as the Form Tools administrator and select the Form Builder
    module from your Modules page. There, click on the "Settings" link in the Form Builder
    navigation at the top of the left sidebar. On the first "Main" tab, change the height
    and width for the "Default Form Builder window size" field. The screenshot to the right
    shows how this page looks and where the field is located.
