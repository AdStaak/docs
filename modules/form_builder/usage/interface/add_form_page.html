  <h3>The Add Form page</h3>

  <p>
    {% include screenshot.html item="i364.gif" %}
    With the Form Builder module installed and enabled, the Add Form page provided
    by the Core script (by default found in the "Add Form" link in the left navigation)
    contains a new "Form Builder" panel, as shown in the screenshot to the right.
  </p>

  <p>
    After selecting the Form Builder option, you will be redirected to a second page where
    you specify a few details about your form (form name, number of fields and permissions).

    {% include screenshot.html item="i369.gif" %}

    All of these settings can be changed later - you're never boxed in by any choice you
    make. If you need to add or remove fields, rename the form or change the permissions,
    this can all be done at a later date.
  </p>
