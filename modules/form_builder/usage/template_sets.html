  <h3>Template Sets</h3>

  <p>
    <i>Template Sets</i> control the look and feel of your published forms. They let you
    customize everything in your published forms - HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
    Like with Form Tools itself, the Form Builder walks that fine line
    between ease of use, and flexibility. With the Form Builder, you're seldom
    in the position where you can't make the form look how you want: it's just a question
    of how willing you are to spend time doing the customization.
  </p>

  <h3>Default template sets</h3>

  <p>
    The Form Builder comes with a number of Template Sets already set up for you to use.
    They don't need any additional customization in order to use and are immediately
    available when you published your first form. To best illustrate how these Template
    Sets look, the screenshots on this page are all of exactly the same form: they are
    simply rendered with different sets (1 click in the Form Builder!).
