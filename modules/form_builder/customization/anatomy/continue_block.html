  <h3>Continue Block</h3>

  <p>
    The Continue Block is used to display the continue button at the bottom of your form and
    Review pages, to allow the users to proceed through the form. All forms have at least two
    pages: a form page and a thankyou page, but it may contain up to 8 pages: 6 form pages,
    a Review page and a Thankyou page.
  </p>

  <p>
    The only requirement for this template is that it contains an HTML submit button with
    a name attribute of "form_tools_continue". The button can have whatever text you want on
    it, and be styled however you want.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here's the default content for this Template Type:
  </p>

  {% raw %}<textarea class="codemirror" data-lang="html">&lt;input type="submit" name="form_tools_continue" value="Continue" /></textarea>{% endraw %}

  <p>
    Tip: if you want to use an image as your submit button, make sure you include a hidden
    field in this template with the name attribute of "form_tools_continue". That will ensure
    the update code gets triggered properly when submitting the form.
  </p>
