  <h3>Using the Smarty templating language</h3>

  <p>
    The Form Builder, like Form Tools, uses the <a href="http://www.smarty.net/" target="_blank">Smarty templating
    language</a> to provide more control over your generated forms. Smarty lets you add logic (if-else, etc.) clauses
    to your templates and resource files, output the content of variables (placeholders), manipulate data and much more.
  </p>

  <p>
    Smarty is fairly easy to learn, and - compared to programming languages - more limited, which simplifies things.
    Currently Form Tools uses version 2 of Smarty, so if you decide to check out their documentation, make sure
    you're looking at the <a href="http://www.smarty.net/docsv2/en/" target="_blank">right version</a>!
  </p>

  <p>
    We won't attempt to teach Smarty here - there's far too much to cover and it would be redundant when there's some
    online documentation available by the original developers. However, a few things are worth bringing up.
  </p>

  <h4>Smarty Delimiters</h4>

  <p>
    Unlike the email templates, Export Manager and other places where Smarty is used, for the Form Builder, Smarty
    delimiters are the double curly brace: {% raw %}<b>{{</b> and <b>}}</b>{% endraw %}. Elsewhere, you use the
    single curly brace. This is because we found that with the Form Builder, you'd often be entering chunks of
    javascript and CSS - both of which use curly braces. So rather than having to force you to enter <b>{literal}</b>
    everywhere (which lets you enter single curly braces normally), we chose to use the double curly-brace delimiter.
  </p>

  <h4>Variables</h4>

  <p>
    To reference a variable (output its contents or access its values), you just use
    the following code:
  </p>

  {% raw %}
<textarea class="codemirror" data-lang="smarty2">
{{$your_var}}
{{$P.your_placeholder}}
{{$R.your_resource}}</textarea>
  {% endraw %}

  <p>
    The your_placeholder variable output the content of a placeholder; the your_resource
    variable outputs a full HTML &lt;link&gt;&amp;; or &lt;script&gt; tag (depending on
    the resource type), to include that resource in your form page.
  </p>

  <h4>Smarty function calls</h4>

  <p>
    Smarty function calls look like variables, except they're missing the <b>$</b>
    character. The Form Builder provides a number of built-in functions to handle the
    generation of particular template types (like <b>{{header}}</b>
    and <b>{{navigation}}</b>).
  </p>

  <h4>Conditional Statements</h4>

  <p>
    Simple if-else statements will be the most likely thing you'll use in your Template
    Sets. They let you include code, show different content - whatever you want. Here's
    a couple of simple examples:
  </p>

{% raw %}
<textarea class="codemirror" data-lang="smarty2">
{{if $your_var == "123"}}
hey!
{{/if}}

{{if $your_var == "xyz"}}
one
{{else}}
two
{{/if}}</textarea>{% endraw %}



{% include close_section.html %}
