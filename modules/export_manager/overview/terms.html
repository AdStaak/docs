  <h3>Export Groups vs. Export Types</h3>

  <p>
    In order to understand how the Export Manager works, it helps to understand the
    meaning of the following two terms.
  </p>

  <p>
    An <b>Export Group</b> is a group of one or more Export Types. It lets you combine
    ways of viewing / exporting the data that possess the same characteristics. For
    example, the printer-friendly format (enabled by default) has three ways to view
    the data: table format, one-by-one and one-submission per page. Since they are so
    similar (they display the data in HTML), they are grouped together in the same group.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Export Types</b> are the actual ways to display / generate the data, e.g.
    displaying all submissions in an HTML table, or in XML format.
  </p>

  <p>
    Combining export types into groups has a number of benefits:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>In the UI, they are all displayed in the same line with the same icon. An
      additional dropdown is shown, listing the available export types.</li>
    <li>Certain features can be abstracted from the individual export type. For
      example, you can define a header and footer, add headers (e.g. to tell the browser to
      treat the export type as CSV, Excel or another format).</li>
    <li>You can define "global" settings for all export types, saving you the bother of
      having to set them again and again for all export types in the group, namely:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Permissions</b> - who can use the export types in this group: administrators, all clients or a subset.</li>
        <li><b>Action</b> - should the file be opened in a popup, a new window or generate a file on the server.</li>
        <li><b>Hide / Show</b> - a simple way to hide / show all export types.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
