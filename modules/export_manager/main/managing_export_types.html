  <h3>Managing Export Types</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i182.gif" %}

  <p>
    The last tab on the Edit Export Group pages contains all the Export Types for that
    group. This is where you can actually see the Smarty code that's used to generate
    the exported content.
  </p>

  <p>
    As with all client-side sortable lists in Form Tools 2.1, to change the sort order of the
    Export Types, just drag and drop the rows to their new position, then click the Update
    Order button to save it. Sortable rows are all identifiable by them having a little up-down
    icon in their Order row.
  </p>

  <h4>Editing an Export Type</h4>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i186.gif" %}

  <p>
    Here's what all the various fields mean on this page.
  </p>

  <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1">
    <tbody><tr>
      <td width="120" valign="top" class="blue">Export Type Name</td>
      <td>
        This is the label that appears in the Export Type dropdown on the Submission Listings
        page to visually identify it. Note: if the Export Group only has a single
        Export Type, no dropdown will appear (since it's not needed).
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" class="blue">Visibility</td>
      <td>
        This determines whether or not the Export Type should show up or not to be used.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" class="blue">Filename</td>
      <td>
        If your Export Group is configured to generate a file, or prompt a download, this
        is the setting that determines the filename. For more information on the placeholders
        that may be used in this field, see the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/export_manager/reference/filename_placeholders">Filename
        Placeholders</a> page.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" class="blue">Smarty Template</td>
      <td>
        And here's where all the work is done! This field contains the Smarty markup
        used to generate the actual markup. It can generate any markup you want, be it XML,
        CSV, HTML or whatever.
      </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody></table>
