  <h3>Editing Export Groups</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i180.gif" %}

  <p>
    The Export Group configuration is spread among 2 or 3 tabs, depending on the version
    of the module you are running. The Export Manager 2.x version introduced a second
    "Permissions" tab, discussed on the next page.
  </p>

  <p>
    The "Main" tab contains all the main settings for the module. In 1.x versions it
    also contains the permissions ("Access Type") setting. See the help on the Permissions
    page for information on that.
  </p>

  <br class="clear">

  <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" class="info">
    <tbody><tr>
      <td width="120" valign="top" class="blue">Export Group Name</td>
      <td>
        This is the label for the Export Group that appears on the Submission Listings
        page to visually identify it.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" class="blue">Visibility</td>
      <td>
        This determines whether or not the Export Group should show up or not. It can be
        handy to disable an entire group while youâ€™re not needing it.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" class="blue">Icon</td>
      <td>
        The icon to associate with the group.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" class="blue">Action</td>
      <td>
        This controls what happens when the user chooses the export group / export type
        on the Submission Listing page. You have three options: generating a file on the
        server, opening in a new window or in a popup (you may specify the dimensions).
        If you're choosing the generate file option, the location of the files that are
        created are specified in the module's <a href="../settings">Settings page</a>.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" class="blue">Action Button Text</td>
      <td>
        This determines what appears on the action button for the export group - it
        should be whatever makes sense, so "Generate" or "Display" seem reasonable.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" class="blue">Headers</td>
      <td>
        This lets you supply some additional headers to be outputted by the server when
        generating the page. For example, take a look at the Excel or CSV Export Groups.
        The Excel Export Group contains headers to tell the browser it's an Excel file
        and to open a dialog to prompt a file download.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" class="blue">Smarty Template</td>
      <td>
        This is where you enter the actual Smarty content for the Export Group. Note:
        this field is just used for the main content: it should include the actual
        Export Type with the <i>{$export_type_smarty_template}</i> template variable.
      </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
