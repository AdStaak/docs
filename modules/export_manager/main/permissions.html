  <h3>Permissions</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i183.gif" %}

  <p>
    The second of the Edit Export Group tabs is labeled Permissions. This lets you fine-tune
    who sees the Export Group and where they should appear.
  </p>

  <h4>Access Type</h4>

  <p>
    For Export Manager 1.x versions, this was found on the Main tab. It lets you control
    which accounts see the Export Group. By default, the Export Groups are visible to
    everyone, regardless of account type.
  </p>

  <h4>Where Shown</h4>

  <p>
    This should be pretty self-explanatory from the description of the options. It lets you
    control which forms and Views the Export Group should appear. For convenience, you can
    either specify those forms and Views that should contain the Export Group, or the inverse:
    those that <i>shouldn't</i>.
  </p>
