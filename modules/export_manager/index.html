  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i181.gif" %}

  <p>
    The Export Manager module provides Form Tools with one of its more important features:
    the ability to view and export your form submission data in any way you wish. Since
    it's such a fundamental feature, this module comes pre-installed with all
    (pre-bundled) Form Tools installations, letting you get to work without any
    additional configuration required. The screenshot to the right is of the 2.0.0
    version of this module, but the functionality has remained largely the same since
    its first release.
  </p>

  <p>
    In new installations, the module provides two ways to download / view your form
    submissions: as an Excel spreadsheet or in an HTML printer-friendly format, which
    has three sub-options: table format, one-by-one and one submission per page. There
    are also two other export methods, hidden by default: CSV (comma separated values)
    and XML. Depending on your needs, these can be enabled by the click of a button.
    But most significantly, once you learn how the module works, you can construct
    whatever other formats you need.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Export Manager, used in conjunction with the Core <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/views">Views</a> feature, acts
    as a fully fledged Report Builder, letting you view and export whatever subset of the
    form data you require. You also have the option to only show the export formats for
    particular clients, particular subsets of your data, and particular forms and Views
    (version 2.0.0 of the module and later only). It's VERY powerful!
  </p>

  <p>
    One final note before we leap into the nitty-gritty: for you programmers /
    advanced users out there, the Export Manager functionality can be utilized via the
    Form Tools API to extract and display Form Tools submission content in your own pages.
    See the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/export_manager/reference/advanced_usage">Advanced Usage</a> section for more info on that.
