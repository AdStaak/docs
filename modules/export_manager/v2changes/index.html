  <h3>Version 2.x: what's changed?</h3>

  <p>
    For those of you familiar with 1.x versions of the Export Manager (i.e. any version that
    works with Form Tools Core 2.0.0 to 2.0.6), here a quick overview of what's changed.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Compatibility with Form Tools Core 2.1.0.</li>
    <li>Client-side sorting for Export Groups and Export Types.</li>
    <li>Better navigation for the export groups.</li>
    <li>Improved permissions. You can now map your Export Groups to particular accounts
      (like with the earlier versions of the module), but now you can also configure them to
      only show up for particular forms / Views. This is helpful if you create custom export
      options that are particular to particular data sets or only offer export options to
      client accounts that see particular Views.</li>
    <li>Assorted UI updates, both for the administration section and the embedded "Export
      Options" section at the bottom the Submissions page. The "all/selected" dropdown is
      now a pair of radios buttons, and there's an icon at the top right of the section
      that links directly to the module for quick reference.</li>
    <li>Reset to Defaults page added. This clears out any changes you've made to the
      export groups + types and returns them to the default values.</li>
    <li>Slight language-type change. Now when you install the script, it installs the
      language strings in the admin's choice of UI language. The fields can still be
      customized using language placeholders, but I think that this is clearer. Seeing the
      placeholders (e.g. <i>{$LANG.export_manager.phrase_html_printer_friendly}</i> instead
      of <i>HTML / Printer Friendly</i>) all over the place is confusing, and it adds no
      value for the majority of users.</li>
    <li>Simpler Smarty markup for the export types, which will hopefully make it easier
      for developers to follow. </li>
    <li>By default, the printer-friendly and Excel export types now include the View
      name in the title.</li>
  </ul>
