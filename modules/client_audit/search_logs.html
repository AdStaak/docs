    Alright! Now let's assume there's been some activity on your client accounts (if you still
    don't see anything when selecting the module, create a dud test account and trying
    tinkering around with it: update settings, login and logout etc). When you return to the
    module, you'll see all the activity logged in a table. Try changing a few search options -
    you'll get the hang of it pretty fast.
