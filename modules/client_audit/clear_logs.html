  <p>
    Installing the Client Audit module is exactly the same as installing any Form Tools module.
    First, download the zip or tar file from the Downloads tab above. Then, follow the
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/modules/installing/">instructions here</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Client Audit module works by tracking <i>changes</i> to client accounts. As such, when
    it's first installed, the module automatically stores the current state - account,
    account settings and account permissions - in its custom logs. Because of this, if
    you have a large number of client accounts, it may take several seconds to configure
    the database.
  </p>

  <p>
    After installing the module, select it. You'll be taken a page that will tell you there's
    been no activity on your client accounts. This is normal. At this point, the module
    is enabled and active: as soon as any changes occur to any client accounts, you
    will start seeing some logged items appear.
