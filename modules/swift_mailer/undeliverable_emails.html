  <h3>Handling Undeliverable Emails</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i106.jpg" %}

  <p>
    How do you know if an email gets there or not? Quite often you <b>don't!</b> To remedy
    this, Swift Mailer adds a new field to your Edit Email Templates page, allowing you to
    specify the email's "return-path" header. This option ensures that all undeliverable
    emails get bounced back to a specific email address rather than just get lost in the
    tubes of the internets.
  </p>

  <p>
    Take a look at the screenshot to the right. When you have Swift Mailer installed you'll
    see the final "Undeliverable Email Recipient" field. This field does NOT appear if
    the Swift Mailer module isn't installed.
