  <h3>File Attachments</h3>

  <p>
    Once the Swift Mailer is up and running, sending file attachments is a breeze. You can
    attach files that were included in the form submission OR files that are found on your
    server. There is no limit to the number of attachments you include, but generally it's a
    good idea to keep the total size to a minimum.
  </p>

  <h4>1. Attaching files from the form submission</h4>

  <p>
    To include a file attachment in your emails, edit the appropriate email template and go to the
    Content tab (where you enter the content for the emails). There, add the following to your
    template (either text or HTML - it doesn't matter which; just as long as it's in one of them):
  </p>

  {% raw %}
  <textarea class="codemirror" data-lang="smarty">{$attachment field="file_field1"}</textarea>
  {% endraw %}

  <p>
    You will need to change the <b>file_field1</b> strings to match the file upload form
    field name. You can include as many file fields are you want.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the submission doesn't contain a file for that field, the email just won't include an
    attachment.
  </p>

  <h4>2. Attaching files from your server</h4>

  <p>
    Attaching files from your server works in a similar way. For example:
  </p>

  {% raw %}
  <textarea class="codemirror" data-lang="smarty">{$attachment file="/folder/myfile.txt"}</textarea>
  {% endraw %}

  <p>
    A couple of things to note:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Note that the attribute is <b>file</b> not <b>field</b>.</li>
    <li>The file path is relative to your Form Tools root. So if your Form Tools folder
      is /formtools, and you have a file that you want to attach that's one folder up, you can put:

      {% raw %}
      <textarea class="codemirror" data-lang="smarty">{$attachment file="../folder/anotherfile.txt"}</textarea>
      {% endraw %}

      This assumes that the <b>$g_root_dir</b> value found in your /global/config.php file
      is correct. We chose to use relative rather than absolute links so that in case you ever
      change servers, you won't have to update each and every email template.
    </li>
  </ul>
