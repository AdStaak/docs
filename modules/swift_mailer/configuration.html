  <h3>Configuration</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i99.jpg" %}
  <p>
    In order to start using the Swift Mailer module to send your emails, you need to do is
    enable the module and supply your SMTP settings. If you don't know this information you will
    need to contact your hosting provider. Note: not all hosting providers offer an SMTP
    service.
  </p>

  <p>
    As shown in the screenshot, there are a number of fields for you to fill in. These should
    all be supplied by your hosting provider or email service. Speaking from experience,
    you may find it a bit of a struggle to find the right combination of settings. It can
    take a fair bit of get configured with the nuances of your SMTP server. If you are
    unsure about the authentication procedure, try systematically choosing one at a time and
    sending yourself a test email, as shown in the screenshot below.
  </p>

  <h4>Confirm everything's working</h4>

  <p>
    To check that everything is working as it should, click on the "Test" tab. That page
    lets you send emails to yourself in various formats.
  </p>

  <p>
    We've tried to include some helpful error messages if the emails are not sent out, but
    they are not exhaustive. If you run into trouble, you might want to try contacting your
    hosting provider for further help.
