  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>
    The File Upload module was written for the 2.1.x Form Tools Core to provide a mechanism to upload files through
    your forms. In 2.0.x releases, this field type was part of the Core code, but it was moved to a separate module to
    accommodate the new field type structure. Why is this better?
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      We can now develop multiple modules to handle different file handling. e.g. have a separate "image" field that
      could create thumbnails. Or, we could update this module - or create another - to allow for uploading multiple
      files at once. [An Image Manager module has been in the works for some time!]
    </li>
    <li>
      Now the file upload functionality is self-contained in a module, it will make it easier for us to roll out changes.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Functionally, this module provides all the same options as 2.0.x releases, only with a slightly different
    interface.
