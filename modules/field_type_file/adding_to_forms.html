  <h3>Adding to your forms</h3>

  <h4>Internal Forms</h4>

  <p>
    Adding file uploads to your internal forms is extremely easy. As an administrator, just
    edit your form and go to the Fields tab. There, pick the "File" field type for the form
    field that you want. You're done! (Really!).
  </p>

  <p>
    To confirm it's working, click on the Edit/View toggle icon at the top right of the page.
    There, create or edit a submission in the form (in a View that contains your file field).
    For the field, try uploading a file. Make sure that the file matches whatever criteria
    you specified on the Settings -&gt; Fields page - namely, size and filetype.
  </p>

  <h4>External Forms</h4>

  <p>
    For external forms, you need to do a little more work - but not too much!
  </p>

  <b>1. Update the &lt;form&gt; tag</b>

  <p>
    Any form that contains a file field needs to let the server know that it contains a
    file. To do this, the form tag needs a new attribute:
  </p>

  <textarea class="codemirror" data-lang="html"><form ... enctype="multipart/form-data"></textarea>

  <b>2. Add the file upload field</b>

  <p>
    This bit's obvious, but make sure your form actually contains the file upload field.
  </p>

  <textarea class="codemirror" data-lang="html"><input type="file" name="yourfilenamefield" /></textarea>

  <b>3. For API forms</b>

  <p>
    For forms that use the API, you'll need to pass the <b>"file_data" =&gt; $_FILES</b>
    key-value pair to the ft_api_process_form function, as shown in <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/api_single_page_form/">this tutorial</a>.
  </p>
