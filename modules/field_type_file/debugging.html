  <h3>Files not uploading?</h3>

  <p>
    Finding that your files aren't uploading properly through your forms is a common problem.
    There are a number of things that could go wrong, from the server configuration, to a
    Form Tools misconfiguration, to the particular file you're trying to upload. Here are
    a few tips to figuring out why it's not working.
  </p>

  <h4>Test in Form Tools!</h4>

  <p>
    If your file isn't uploading through your external form, log into Form Tools, create
    a new form submission (or edit an existing one) and try uploading the file there. This
    can help you in a couple of ways:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li><b>Less potential errors</b>. The forms within the Form Tools interface are
      preconfigured to handle the file uploads, so it's more likely to succeed there.</li>
    <li><b>Useful error messages</b>. Form Tools will try to provide helpful error messages
      if the file can't be uploaded. For instance, it will tell you if your file upload folder
      can't be written to, if the file is too large or of an non-permitted file type. This
      can go a long way into identifying the source of the problem.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    If your file doesn't upload in the Form Tools interface, you should see some sort of
    error explaining why it could not. If it <i>does</i> upload, that means there is a problem
    with your form. Check over the previous <a href="../adding_to_forms">Add to your
    forms</a> page to confirm that you've done all the necessary steps.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you've read through all the instructions and still have problems, it's possible that
    the server isn't configured properly. You might want to take whatever your discovered
    to your hosting provider to ask their advice. The most common form of server error
    is that the temporary file upload folder isn't set up properly, or the folder doesn't
    have write-permissions.
