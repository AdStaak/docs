  <h3>File Settings</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i320.jpg" %}

  <p>
    Using the file field is very simple: you just choose the "File" field type for any
    field on the Edit Form -&gt; Fields tab, and the field will show up as a file upload field
    within the Form Tools interface. It will use the file upload field defined in the
    Settings -&gt; Files tab.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, you may find it useful to change the default file upload folder, or other
    settings. To do that, click the Edit icon on the Edit Form -&gt; Fields tab to open up the
    Edit Field dialog window. There, click on the second tab. That contains all the custom
    settings, as illustrated in the screenshot to the right. Here's what all the settings
    mean.
  </p>

  <table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="0" width="100%">
    <tbody><tr>
      <td class="blue" width="220" valign="top">Open Link with Fancybox</td>
      <td>
        "Fancybox" is a script used to open up (usually) images in a dialog window when
        clicking on their link in the Form Tools interface. Fancybox
        was added in 2.1.0 to replace the earlier "Lightbox" script. Generally you'll
        only want to enable this for file upload fields that store an image.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Folder Path</td>
      <td>
        This setting controls the folder to which the files are uploaded. The default
        folder is defined in the Settings -&gt; Files page. If you update the folder path
        here, you must also update the following Folder URL setting, in order to ensure
        the files are linked to properly.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Folder URL</td>
      <td>
        This setting specifies the URL of the file upload folder for the field. The default
        folder is defined in the Settings -&gt; Files page. As with the previous field: you
        need to update the Folder Path field if you ever want to change the Folder URL.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Permitted File Types</td>
      <td>
        This overrides the default permitted file types that may be uploaded through
        the field. The default file types are specified on the Settings -&gt; Files page.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Max File Sizes (KB)</td>
      <td>
        This overrides the default max file size that can be uploaded through
        the field. The default max file size is specified on the Settings -&gt; Files page.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Field Comments</td>
      <td>
        All field contain this optional setting: it lets you add some arbitrary text that
        appear underneath the field, when editing it. This can provide a little information
        to the Form Tools user who sees the field.
      </td>
