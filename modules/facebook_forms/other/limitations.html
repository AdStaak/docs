  <h3>Known Limitations</h3>

  <p>
    This is a pretty cool module, but there are a few limitations:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>This module doesn't support multi-page forms. All forms are listed on a single page,
      regardless of whether you've arranged the fields into tabs.</li>
    <li>The "thankyou" page doesn't currently permit any "dynamic" data (e.g. referencing
      values from the form submission, or displaying stats of all submissions made to date).
    </li>
    <li>The validation is currently very simple: only permitting you to specify which fields
      are required, not things like email address format verification, checking that only numbers
      were entered, etc.</li>
    <li>The <a href="/modules/field_type_google_maps/" target="_blank">Google Maps field type module</a> is not
      compatible.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
