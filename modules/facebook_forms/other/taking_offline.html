  <h3>Taking your form offline</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i240.gif" %}

  <p>
    Once you're done with your form and you don't want to show it online anymore, one solution
    is to simply delete the Facebook App via the Facebook developers section. But that's not
    very elegant: any existing links to that page will become broken. So instead, all you
    need to do is change the status of the form to "offline". Once that's done, anyone visiting
    the form will see a custom message that you want them to see.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here's how it works.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the Facebook Forms module (listed on your Form Tools Modules page), click the edit
    icon for the Facebook form you want to take offline. There, on the first "Main" tab,
    change "Status" to "offline".
  </p>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i242.gif" %}

  <p>
    At this point, your form is offline. However, you probably want to customize what people
    see when they go to the page. To control that, go to Labels/Text tab and scroll down to
    the "Offline Form" section. There, you can change the title and content of the page.

{% include close_section.html %}
