  <h3>Tutorial: creating a Facebook form</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i239.gif" %}

  <p>
    At this stage, your form now appears on Facebook, submissions are being sent to Form Tools
    and the people submitting the form are redirected to a generic "thanks!" page. So far so
    good. But you may want to make a few small changes to your form. The following sections
    explain how to do different things.
  </p>

  <div class="clear"></div>
  <h3>1. Adding a "Like" button</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i238.gif" %}

  <p>
    The "Like" button is a great way to promote your form, and adding it is very simple. Back
    in the Form Tools Facebook Forms module, edit your form configuration and click on the
    "Advanced" tab. There, set the "Show Like Button" to "yes" and enter the full URL of your
    Facebook Canvas Page in the field below (i.e. the URL you enter in your browser to see the
    form). Click save and you're done! A "Like" button will appear at the bottom of your form,
    as shown in the screenshot at the top of the page.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Customizing the form labels and text</h3>

  <p>
    The Facebook Forms module gives you a lot of control over what is actually output to
    your form. Just click on the "Labels/Text" tab to see what is available.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Forcing the user to fill in certain fields</h3>

  <p>
    As mentioned at the top of the "Validation" tab, at the time the module was developed
    the Form Tools Core doesn't support adding in field validation. This is slated for the
    next release, but you shouldn't have to wait that long! So to add validation, just
    check those fields you want to be required and add in the error message that should appear
    if they are not. Required fields will appear with a <span class="red">*</span> red asterix
    next to the row label and will cause a "Please fill in required fields" dialog window to
    appear if the user attempts to submit the form without filling them in.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Customizing the Thankyou page</h3>

  <p>
    By default, the thankyou page is very plain. To customize the text that the user sees, just
    go to the ""Labels/Text" tab and in the Thankyou Page section, enter whatever you want!
  </p>
