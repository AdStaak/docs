  <h3>Tutorial: creating a Facebook form</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i239.gif" %}

  <p>
    This section of the documentation is a hands-on tutorial that explains how to create a form and get it displayed
    on Facebook. Click on the screenshot to the right to see the end result: we'll be creating a simple survey that
    asks people to rate social networks. Even though the form is very simple, you'll be able to apply the same process
    to your own forms, regardless of complexity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alternatively, if you already have a form set up in Form Tools and would like to
    use that instead, go right ahead! After finishing this page, just skip steps 1 and 2
    and go straight to <a href="configure_module/">installing and configuring the module</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before leaping into the tutorial, let's start with a quick overview of the
    whole process.
  </p>

  <h3>How it works</h3>

  <p>
    Your forms are implemented as Facebook "Apps". Apps are really just code that runs
    on websites outside of facebook.com itself. In our case, the code is running your
    website, through the Facebook Forms module. Normally, it's the responsibility of App
    developers to create applications and code that is compatible and consistent with
    Facebook. The Facebook Forms module does exactly that: it converts Form Tools forms
    to run properly on Facebook - so you really don't need to know the nasty details.
  </p>

  <p>
    The process of adding your forms works like this:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>You create a form in Form Tools (Internal or External, API or POST - anything is fine!)</li>
    <li>You go to the Facebook Form module and supply a few basic configuration information (only 2 fields are necessary)</li>
    <li>You create a unique App URL for it via the Facebook developer section (This is REALLY easy)</li>
    <li>You optionally return to the Form Tools module to make a few minor tweaks, like making the "Like" button
      appear, and changing the occasional label, and, well... you're done!</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Alright, enough chatter - let's go to our tutorial so you can see something more concrete.
    I really think you'll find the process exceedingly simple once you see how it works.
