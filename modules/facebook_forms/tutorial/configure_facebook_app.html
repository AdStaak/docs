  <h3>Configuring your Facebook App</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i236.gif" %}

  <p>
    This bit may sound scary, but it's really not! Facebook have made it very easy for people
    to create their own Apps on Facebook. Here's what you do.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Go to <a href="http://developers.facebook.com" target="_blank">http://developers.facebook.com</a>
      and click on the Apps link on the top bar. There, you will need to log in. For this, you can
      use your existing Facebook username and password. After you log in, you should see a page that looks
      something like the screenshot above.</li>
    <li>Click the "+ Create New App" button. In the dialog window that appears, enter the name of
      your app (for this example, call it "Survey") and agree to the terms. The first time
      you create an app, Facebook require you supplying your mobile phone number and/or credit
      card information. Don't worry - it doesn't cost money to add your forms to Facebook.</li>
    <li>After you've filled that in, you'll be redirected to a page in Facebook where you can
      configure your App. Let's leave that alone for a moment. In another tab, open up Form
      Tools and go to the Facebook Forms module. On the main page you should now see your
      configured form. On the "Facebook Canvas URL" column, click the "View URL" button. A dialog
      window will appear containing a URL. Copy that URL to your clipboard, and return to
      the Facebook page.</li>
    <li>Click on the "On Facebook" link in the left navigation and in the "Canvas"
      section on the page, enter the name of whatever you want your application URL to be.
      Every application needs to have a unique name, so try entering different values until
      you find one that's available. In the "Canvas URL" field beneath it, paste in the URL
      you copied from Form Tools and click save. You're done!</li>
  </ol>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i237.gif" %}

  <p>
    After you wait a few minutes for Facebook to create your app, enter the URL you Canvas page
    URL you selected into your browser. You should see a form something like the screenshot
    to the right. Nice! Your form is now added to Facebook! But let's do a couple of touch-ups.
