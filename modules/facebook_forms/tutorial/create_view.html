  <h3>Create a custom View</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i232.gif" %}

  <p>
    The next step is to create a View of the form that contains only those fields we need to
    see. This is very similar to creating Views for use in Form Tools, with one exception:
    some data won't be relevant. When a user visits the form, there isn't a submission already
    created, so there's no point including any of the Core fields: Submission ID,
    Submission Date, Last Modified Date and IP Address. If your View includes those fields,
    they'll simply appear blank!
  </p>

  <p>
    To create a new View, just go to the Edit Form -&gt; Views tab, and click "Add View". In the
    dialog window that appears, create a new View based on the existing "All submissions"
    View, as per the screenshot above.
  </p>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i233.gif" %}

  <p>
    On the Edit View page, go to the Fields tab and configure the View fields like in the second
    screenshot. Note we've created the
    Views in two groups: "Social Networks" and "Other".
  </p>

  <h3>A word on Tabs</h3>

  <p>
    Form Tools lets you organize your field Views into tabs. But for our Facebook forms,
    this isn't relevant: the form will always be listed on a single page.
  </p>

  <p>
    So bear in mind that if your View fields are grouped into tabs, they will be ignored
    on your Facebook form and just listed sequentially.
