  <h3>Creating the form in Form Tools</h3>

  <p>
    The first step is to create our form. As mentioned earlier, this module is compatible with <i>any</i> type of
    Form Tools form (API or POST, Internal or External), but to keep it simple, we're going to create an Internal form:
    this is a form that is created and managed entirely through Form Tools. Once it's set up, we're going to get it
    listed on Facebook. (To learn more about the difference between Internal and External forms,
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/form_management/form_types">give this page</a> a read over).
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're in a rush and don't want to fuss around with all the details
    of configuring this example form, just complete steps 1-2 on this page then continue
    on. Your form won't be complete, but you'll still get a good idea how it all works.
  </p>

  <table width="100%">
    <tbody><tr>
      <th width="60">Step</th>
      <th>Instructions</th>
      <th width="250">Screenshot</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" class="bold">1</td>
      <td valign="top">
        Log into Form Tools on your site and click on the Add Form link in the left
        navigation menu. There, select the Internal form option.
      </td>
      <td>
        {% include screenshot.html item="i208.gif" %}
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" class="bold">2</td>
      <td valign="top">
        On the following page, enter the following information:
        <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
          <tbody><tr>
            <td width="140"><b>Form Name</b></td>
            <td>Survey</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><b>Number of fields:</b></td>
            <td>8</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><b>Access:</b></td>
            <td>Administrator Only</td>
          </tr>
          </tbody></table>
      </td>
      <td>{% include screenshot.html item="i227.gif" %}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" class="bold">3</td>
      <td valign="top">
        After you submit the previous page, you'll be redirected to the Edit Form page. There,
        click on the Fields tab. This is where you configure your form fields to store whatever
        information you want. At this step, just enter the Display Text and Field Type columns
        as shown in the screenshot. Note: if you don't have the
        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/field_type_tinymce/">tinyMCE Field</a>
        module installed, you won't see the "WYSIWYG" option to select for the "Additional Comments?"
        row. Just select the Textarea option instead.
      </td>
      <td valign="top">{% include screenshot.html item="i228.gif" %}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" class="bold">4</td>
      <td valign="top">
        Next we need to create the Option Lists for the radio and dropdown fields. Click on
        "Option Lists" in the navigation menu. There, create a new Option List with the values
        shown in the screenshot to the right. These are the options that will be available
        for our "Ratings" fields (rows 2 to 6 on the Edit Form -&gt; Fields page).
      </td>
      <td>{% include screenshot.html item="i229.gif" %}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" class="bold">5</td>
      <td valign="top">
        Now, return to the Edit Form -&gt; Fields tab, click the edit icon for the Facebook row
        and on the second tab, select the new "Ratings" Option List you created in the previous
        step. Do the same for the next 4 fields (Twitter, Google+, Linked In, MySpace). Tip:
        it's fastest to just click the "next field" link to go from one field to the next. When
        you're done, click "Update".
      </td>
      <td>{% include screenshot.html item="i230.gif" %}</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i231.gif" %}

  <p>
    Okay! Our form is now set up. On the Edit Form -&gt; Fields tab, click the grey icon at
    the top right. That lets you toggle between editing the form and viewing the form data.
    On the View data page, click the "Add Â»" button to create a new submission in
    your form. You should get redirected to a page that looks like the screenshot to the
    right. It's not perfect, but we're getting there!
