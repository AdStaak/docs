  <h3>Displaying tab</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i334.gif" %}

  <p>
    Now we're getting into the fun stuff! The second <i>Displaying</i> tab controls everything
    related to how the field type is displayed: it lets you customize every last character
    that appears in the markup. It lets you interact with the (custom) field type settings
    so that the markup changes depending on how it's configured - and lots more!
  </p>

  <p>
    The Displaying tab is separated into four sub-tabs:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li><b>View Field</b> - this determines the code used to generate the field content when
      it's being <i>viewed</i>. Fields are viewed in different places, based on the context. The
      two most common places are on the Submission Listing page, and on the Edit Submission page
      when the field is marked as uneditable.</li>
    <li><b>Edit Field</b> - this controls the markup used to display the <i>editable</i>
      version of the field.</li>
    <li><b>CSS</b> - this lets you add in any custom CSS needed for the field type.</li>
    <li><b>Javascript</b> - this lets you add in any custom javascript needed for the field type./li&gt;
    </li>
  </ol>
