  <h3>Validation tab</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i336.gif" %}

  <p>
    Form Tools 2.1.4 added the option to offer field validation in your Form Tools forms.
    We implemented this as a field-type specific feature, since certain validation rules only
    make sense for certain field types. For example, you won't need a "valid email only"
    validation rule for a group of checkboxes or a WYSIWYG field, but you would for a textbox.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Validation tab lets you create and customize those validation rules.
