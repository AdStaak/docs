  <h3>The main page</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i189.gif" %}
  <p>
    When you select the module from your modules page, you'll see a page much like the
    screenshot to the right. This page lists all field types in the database. Let's look at
    each different element in the page individually: there's a lot here!
  </p>

  <h4>Groups</h4>

  <p>
    The first thing you'll notice is that the field types are arranged into two groups:
    <i>Standard Fields</i> and <i>Special Fields</i>. This grouping affects how the
    field types are listed in the Edit Form -&gt; Fields tab, whenever you select the field
    type for a form field. Using this module, you can change the group names and order
    to whatever you want.
  </p>

  <h4>Ordering</h4>

  <p>
    Like much of Form Tools, the field types and groups on this page can be sorted.
    To change the sort order of a field type, just click the first "Order" column and
    drag the row up or down. To move it to a different group, just drag it over!
  </p>

  <p>
    To re-sort the groups, click and drag the group via the icon at the top right of the
    group.
  </p>

  <h4>The field type tables</h4>

  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1" class="info">
    <tbody><tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top" width="180">Order</td>
      <td>As mentioned above, you can click on this row to re-order the field types.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Field Type</td>
      <td>The name of the field type.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Identifier</td>
      <td>This is used programmatically to uniquely identify the field types. Identifiers
        must be unique.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Compatible Field Sizes</td>
      <td>
        This lists all the field sizes that are compatible for this field type. This allows
        you to prevent users accidentally allocating too much or too little database
        storage for a field, depending on what is being stored. For example, a "Date" string
        only needs a few characters in the database, but a textarea field potentially
        requires a great deal.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Validation</td>
      <td>
        This lists the number of validation rules defined for this field type. These
        appear as options in the third "Validation" tab of the
        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/field_types/edit_field_dialog">Edit Field dialog</a>.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Settings</td>
      <td>
        This lists the number of settings available for the field. These
        appear as options in the second "Settings" tab of the
        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/field_types/edit_field_dialog">Edit Field dialog</a>.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">"Edit" icon</td>
      <td>
        As with most Form Tools tables, click this icon to edit the field. Some fields
        (those with an "info" icon on the next column) can't actually be edited, but you
        can still click around the pages to see how the field is configured.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">"Delete" icon</td>
      <td>
        The final column lets you delete an entire field type. You'll notice that some
        columns forbid you from deleting them and just show an "info" icon. That icon appears
        for the "Textbox" and "Date" field types, and for any external field type module
        (Google Maps, file upload, tinyMCE etc). External field type modules may only be
        deleted by uninstalling the module. The Textbox and Date field types cannot be deleted
        because the Core fields (submission ID, submission Date etc) require them.
      </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody></table>

  <h4>Adding new Types and Groups</h4>

  <p>
    To add groups and types, just
    click on the appropriate link on the page. The "Add Field Type Â»" links are found at the
    bottom-right of all groups. When you click that, a dialog window appears that lets you
    create a new field type from scratch - or based on an existing one.
