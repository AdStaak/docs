  <h3>Custom Fields</h3>

    <b>Warning: this is an advanced module, intended for web developers</b>. You need to
    have some expertise in HTML, CSS, JS, Smarty and PHP.

  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>
    {% include screenshot.html item="i189.gif" %}
    The Custom Fields module lets you customize and create those very field types that
    you see in your forms: textboxes, textareas, etc. This is an <i>incredibly</i>
    powerful module. In the immortal words of Keanu Reeves: <i>"Whoaahhh"</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Custom Fields module is special. It was designed alongside version 2.1.0 of the
    Form Tools Core to provide a new level of flexibility in the field types and what
    options are available to configure them. Rather than distributing this functionality
    with the main release, we decided that it would lead to a lot of confusion and
    people potentially breaking their installations. So instead, the Custom Fields module
    is released separately, only for people who need that advanced functionality.
  </p>

  <p>
    In Form Tools 2.0.x, there was a hardcoded list of available field types. These
    were all the common fields types that you've seen in any web form: textboxes, password
    fields, textareas, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, multi-select dropdowns,
    file upload fields and a TinyMCE WYSIWYG field. Although these field types covered
    most typical needs, it was inconsistently implements (e.g. the date picker could
    only be used by the Core's Submission Date field), and couldn't be easily changed.
    With the up and coming HTML5 field types (dates, colour pickers, sliders and so on),
    we decided to devote 2.1.x to restructuring the Core to be flexible in how those field
    types are displayed, saved, processed and managed. The end result was the Custom
    Fields module.

    <li>Modify existing field types, including adding new configurable settings to existing ones.</li>
    <li>Allocated database storage for the fields</li>
    <li>Control every character that is used in displaying and editing the field type.</li>

  </ul>
