  <h3>Adding Field Types</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i338.gif" %}
  <p>
    Adding a new field type is very simple. After selecting the module, click the appropriate
    "Add Field Type Â»" link, found at the bottom right of the field type groups. That
    will open a dialog window that looks like the screenshot to the right. Here's what
    the fields mean.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Field Name</b>. This is a string that best describes your field type (e.g. "Modified
    textbox", "Calendar widget" or whatever is most appropriate). It doesn't have to be
    unique, but we strongly suggest you name it something different to what's already
    defined!
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Field Type Identifier</b>. This field must be unique. In the database, field types
    are stored in the <b>[prefix]field_types</b> table, which uses an auto-increment column
    to identify and reference them in the code. This numeric ID may be different for
    each installation, so instead, this field allows you to provide a simple, human-friendly
    string to identify your field type. There are functions in the Form Tools code base
    (such as <b>ft_get_field_type_by_identifier()</b>) that allow you to reference field
    types by their string ID instead their auto-increment value. This field must be
    alphanumeric, and should be lower-case for consistency. This value <i>cannot be
    changed</i> after you define it here.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Group</b>. The group to which the field type belongs. You can group them however
    you want through the Custom Fields main page.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Base field type on...</b> This is a simple time-saving device. It creates a new
    field type with all of the exact settings of another. <i>Please note</i>, however,
    that for non-Core field types (i.e. field types defined through separate modules),
    this will <b>not</b> copy over any template or code hooks defined. So don't be surprised
    if you make a copy of the Google Maps field type and find that your new version doesn't
    work!
  </p>

  <p>
    After you have created your new field type, you'll be redirected to the edit section
    where you can customize it. For information on that, see the upcoming
    <a href="../editing_field_types">Editing Field Types</a> section.
