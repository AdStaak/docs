<h3>Breaking changes in 2.1.0</h3>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    As of Form Tools 3.0.10, you can <b>no longer edit the core field types</b> through this module. Anyone who has
    edited the core fields using this module in earlier versions should:
    <ul>
        <li>Update to version 2.1.0 of this module (and Form Tools Core 3.0.10)</li>
        <li>Make copies of the field types you edited.</li>
        <li>Use those new field types in your forms</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h3>What's going on</h3>

<p>
    This was an oversight on my part. I didn't consider the problems here, and only recently noticed the documentation
    for this module was incorrect: <b>Form Tools can't guarantee it won't overwrite the core field types whenever you
    upgrade the Form Tools Core</b>. Originally it purported to do just that, but I found this wasn't practically
    possible: occasionally bugs would arise in the field types which need patching. Fixing those bugs necessarily
    meant overwriting changes you may have made to them via this module.
</p>

<p>
    So to prevent any future problems, the Form Tools Core now locks down those core fields types. However, you can
    still copy them and make changes to the copies - and hide the original field types from View. So from a UI perspective
    the change won't be noticeable.
