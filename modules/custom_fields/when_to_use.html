  <h3>When to use?</h3>

  <p>
    Since field types can be created and managed separately through both separate modules
    <i>or</i> the Custom Fields module, which should you choose? Which is a better fit
    for what you're trying to do?
  </p>


  <h4>What it's good for</h4>

  <p>
    The Custom Fields module provides a relatively simple interface for creating and
    managing your field types, so for things like making small change to the field
    types, adding new (simple) ones, adding validation rules, adding new settings and
    so on and so forth, it's perfect.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, once browsers implement the new HTML5 standards better and we start seeing
    sliders and colour-pickers as native form elements, creating them through this module
    is an absolute breeze.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's also exceedingly good as a workarea to try things out. The File upload, Google
    Maps and WYSIWYG modules were all initially created via this module. I moved them into
    separate modules for a number of reasons, including the fact that they are optional.
    Placing them in separate modules allows users to only install those component that
    they need.
  </p>

  <h4>What it's <i>not</i> good for</h4>

  <p>
    Advanced stuff. The file upload field, for example, is placed in a separate module
    due to the complex server-side code that is needed to handle all the different
    places that files are uploaded. The Custom Fields interface also doesn't allow you to
    override <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/module_development/hooks">code or template hooks</a>: for that, you'll need a separate module.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you require separate resource files (JS, Flash etc), you can <i>link</i> to
    them via the module, but there's no facility to upload them to the site. So either
    you need to use FTP to upload them, or wrap them in a separate module.
  </p>

  <h4>Still Not sure?</h4>

    If you're not sure about whether you should pick this module to create your field
    types / changes, <a href="https://forums.formtools.org">pipe up in the forums</a> and
