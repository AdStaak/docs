<h3>The Core Field Types</h3>

<p>
    The Form Tools Core come pre-bundled with the field types listed below. Between them, these field types cover all of
    the most typical fields needed in people's forms. Each field type comes prefigured with the appropriate settings
    and validation so no additional configuration is needed.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Textboxes</li>
    <li>Password fields</li>
    <li>Textareas</li>
    <li>Radio Buttons</li>
    <li>Checkboxes</li>
    <li>Dropdown fields</li>
    <li>Multi-select dropdowns</li>
    <li>Dates</li>
    <li>Times</li>
    <li>Phone Number fields</li>
    <li>Code / Markup fields</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This module lets you make copies of any of these Core field types, which you can modify in whatever way you wish.
</p>

<h3>Other Field Types</h3>

<p>
    In addition, field types may also be created via separate modules. This has several benefits over using the Custom
    Fields module, but it's considerably more complex. The following modules all provide new field types - but you can
    add any more that you wish.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/field_type_file/">File Upload field</a></li>
    <li><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/field_type_tinymce/">TinyMCE (WYSIWYG) field</a></li>
    <li><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/field_type_google_maps/">Google Maps field</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
    Just like the core fields, any module that extends the Core with their own field types <b>cannot</b> be edited
    via the Custom Fields module. You can use the module to browse their configurations to see how they've been set
    up, but you won't be able to update them. This ensures that you never make changes to those field type configurations
    which are later overwritten by updates to the module.
