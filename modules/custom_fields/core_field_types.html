  <h3>The Core Field Types</h3>

  <p>
    The Form Tools Core come pre-bundled with the field types listed below. Between
    them, these field types cover all of the most typical fields needed in
    people's forms. Each field type comes prefigured with the appropriate settings
    and validation so no additional configuration is needed.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Textboxes</li>
    <li>Password fields</li>
    <li>Textareas</li>
    <li>Radio Buttons</li>
    <li>Checkboxes</li>
    <li>Dropdown fields</li>
    <li>Multi-select dropdowns</li>
    <li>Dates</li>
    <li>Times</li>
    <li>Phone Number fields</li>
    <li>Code / Markup fields</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This module lets you edit any of these Core field types, with the exception of
    <i>textboxes</i> and <i>dates</i>. Those two field types have hardcoded references in
    the Core (for the Submission ID, Last Modified, Submission Date and IP Address)
    and cannot be changed. Instead, the module allows you to make copies of them, which
    you can then edit.
  </p>

  <h4>Additional Field Types</h4>

  <p>
    In addition, field types may also be created via separate modules. This has several
    benefits over using the Custom Fields module, but it's considerably more complex.
    <a href="https://formtools.org/download/">The main Form Tools download package</a>,
    contains two additional field type modules:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/field_type_file/">File Upload field</a></li>
    <li><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/field_type_tinymce/">TinyMCE (WYSIWYG) field</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Any module that extends the Core with their own field types <b>cannot</b> be edited
    via the Custom Fields module. You can use the module to browse their configurations
    to see how they've been set up, but you won't be able to update them. This ensures
    that you never make changes to those field type configurations which are later
    overwritten by updates to the module.
