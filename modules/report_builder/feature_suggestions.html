  <h3>Feature Suggestions</h3>

  <p>
    We LOVE to get feature suggestions - and we take them very seriously. So if you have an
    idea on how to improve this module, or feel that a particular piece of functionality
    is conspicuously absent, <a href="https://github.com/formtools/module-report_builder/issues">create a new issue
    here</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    We read all feature suggestions, and are particularly interested in expanding the
    functionality of our premium modules. So let us know!
