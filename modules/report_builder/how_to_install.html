  <h3>How to install</h3>

  <p>
    Installing the module works just like any other module - very simply! <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/modules/installing">Take a
    look at this page</a> for instructions.
  </p>

  <h4>Configuring the module</h4>

  <p>
    After you've installed it, you're actually all done! Now, when you or your clients
    visit a form page, they will see a new icon appear at the top right of the submissions
    table. When clicked, it will open up a dialog window containing a list of all reports
    (i.e. Views) for your form. Take a look at the screenshot to the right for an example of
    how that looks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although the Reports icon is a quick, convenient way to present an overview of all
    available Views, you want to add a link to the reports in the navigation menu. That
    way, looking at the reports for any form is just one click away - regardless
    of the page you're on.
