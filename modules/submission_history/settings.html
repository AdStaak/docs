  <h3>Settings page</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i164.jpg" %}

  <p>
    The settings page contains all the settings that are pertinent to the module. Here's
    a description of what each setting means.
  </p>

  <h4>Main Settings</h4>

  <p>
    These settings relate to the overall functioning of the script and provide a few
    controls over limiting the log size. If database size is an issue, these settings
    can really come in handy.
  </p>

  <div class="clear"></div>

  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1" class="info" width="100%">
    <tbody><tr>
      <th width="260">Setting</th>
      <th>Purpose</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" class="blue">Automatically track activity for all new forms</td>
      <td>
        By default, this setting is enabled ("Yes"). It lets you choose whether or not
        you want to track activity for forms that you haven't created yet - for forms
        that you will be adding sometime in the future. If you're only interested in tracking
        the submission history for a particular form or forms, you should set this field
        to "no".
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" class="blue">Limit submission history size to # records</td>
      <td>
        This is the first of three settings that let you control the maximum size of your
        submission history tables. This setting limits the total size for
        <b>each submission</b>. So if you were to set this to "20 records", the module
        would only track the last 50 changes to a submission - older changes are dropped.
        The default value is 50.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" class="blue">Limit total table log size to # records</td>
      <td>
        This setting lets you ensure that the total size of the history table never exceeds
        a certain number of rows. This setting is independent of the actual submissions: it
        will always delete the oldest history rows that exceed the total permissable row
        count. By default, this setting is set to empty - it doesn't limit the table log
        size.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" class="blue">Auto-delete history older than...</td>
      <td>
        This setting provides another alternative way to keep your submission history logs
        in check. It will automatically delete all history that's older than a particular
        date - e.g. 1 week, 6 months or a year. This setting is also set to empty by
        default (i.e. if never deletes old history).
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" class="blue">Num Deleted Submissions Per Page</td>
      <td>
        This settings determines the number of deleted submissions displayed per page
        on the "Undelete" page for each form. You can find that page by clicking the "UNDELETE"
        link on the <a href="../tracking">Tracking page</a> for each form.
      </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h4>Edit Submission Page</h4>

  <p>
    These settings affect the appearance and functionality of the history panel
    that appears at the bottom of the administrator's Edit Submission page.
  </p>

  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1" width="100%">
    <tbody><tr>
      <th width="260">Setting</th>
      <th>Purpose</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" class="blue">Submission history section label</td>
      <td>
        This is the label that appears to identify the submission history panel
        on the administrator's Edit Submission page.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" class="blue">Auto-load history on edit submission page</td>
      <td>
        This setting lets you choose whether or not the submission history panel should
        automatically show the history when you're browsing your submissions.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" class="blue">Num history listed per page</td>
      <td>
        This determines the number of submission history items to show on the Edit Submission
        page. By default, it's set to 10. Whenever there is more history to display than
        can fit on a page, you will see some <b>« 1 2 3 »</b> pagination.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" class="blue">Date Format</td>
      <td>
        This setting controls the formatting of the dates in the submission history panel.
        As with all other date format settings in Form Tools, the format is determined
        by the <a href="http://ca2.php.net/manual/en/function.date.php" target="_blank">PHP
        date function</a>.
      </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
