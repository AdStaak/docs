  <h3>Viewing a Change</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i162.gif" %}

  <p>
    The VIEW link shows a separate page listing all fields - and highlights (in yellow)
    those fields that have changed from the previous version. It also provides a simple
    navigation so you can navigate forwards and backwards along the change history, if you're
    curious to find out who changed what, when.
