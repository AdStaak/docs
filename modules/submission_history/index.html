  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i160.gif" %}

  <p>
    The Submission History module provides an important service: it tracks changes to your
    form submissions so you can browse changes - who made what change and when - as well as
    restore older versions, and even undelete entire submissions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's start with a little behind-the-scenes discussion of how the module works.
  </p>

  <h4>How it works</h4>

  <p>
    The Submission History module creates copies of all your form table structures, with
    some additional "meta" information for each submission row. Then, any time data in
    your form is added, edited or deleted, corresponding entries are made in the form's
    history table. Likewise, if you ever changed your form - add, delete or edit database
    fields - the history table is updated as well.

  <p>
    All the submission activity information is then displayed to the administrator via a
    separate panel at the bottom of the Edit Submission page. Administrators can browse
    the changes to the submissions to see what changed and when.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since a log for an individual submission can get pretty large (hundreds, even thousands
    of edits), you may not want the history to get loaded each and every time you view a
    form submission: it can add slow down the speed at which your page loads. With this
    in mind, the module was developed as an Ajax component: it only starts loading the
    history log after the rest of the page has loaded via an Ajax call. Secondly, there's
    a configuration setting to choose whether or not you want the history to be displayed
    on page load. If the submission history isn't something you'd be looking at very often,
    this can be a handy option. See the
    <a href="../settings">Settings page</a> for more information on that setting.
  </p>

  <h4>Limitations</h4>

  <p>
    This module is ONLY for administrators. The whole module is centered around the
    openness of the data: who edited what, when. Client accounts are discrete entities: they
    don't know about each other. It simple seemed inappropriate to open up this information
    to each client account. If you don't like it, make a case in the forums and we can
    discuss it! :)
