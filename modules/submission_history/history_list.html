  <h3>The History List</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i163.gif" %}

  <p>
    The History List show up as a paginated list of changed, most recent to oldest in a
    blue box at the foot of the page. It's mostly self-explanatory, but here's a few
    extra notes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <b>Change Type</b> column shows the type of change to the submission. The possible
    values are: <b>new</b>, <b>update</b>, <b>delete</b> and <b>undelete</b> - which are
    all self-explanatory. You may also see: <b>submission</b>, meaning that the submission
    was updated by the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/submission_accounts/?page=index">Submission
    Account module</a>, <b>restore</b> - meaning that you, the administrator restored an
    older version from the submission history list, and <b>original</b>. This last one
    appears when you install the module and then update a submission. In this case,
    none of the submissions have any history already logged. So Instead of just
    logging the new change, in this case two history items are logged: the <b>original</b>
    state of the submission, and the new <b>update</b>. "Original" seemed a more accurate
    way to identify the change type than just re-use "new".
  </p>

  <p>
    The <b>Changed By</b> column lists which user made the change to the submission. If
    it's a client account, it will be a link to that account. If it was updated by the
    user via the Submission Accounts module, it will just show "Submission Accounts module".
  </p>

  <p>
    The <b>Changed Fields</b> column contains a dropdown showing (a) how many fields were
    changed in the update, and which fields. Click on the VIEW link for a more complete
    display of the changed data.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the very bottom of the page is a button labeled "Clear Submission Log". This will
    delete all history for this submission.
