  <h3>How to Use</h3>

  <p>
    {% include screenshot.html item="i357.gif" %}
    Once your settings are created and populated, now you'll want to actually use them
    in your code! This is really very simple. Click on the "How to Use" navigation link
    in the module and copy and paste the code into your PHP page. Note: if your page already
    include the Form Tools API or the library.php, you won't need to re-include it.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the page describes, you can use the $settings var to access any of the values you
    want. Note that checkbox and multi-select field will have their (multiple) values
    serialized into a pipe-delimited string. To convert them to an array, just
    <b>explode("|", $settings["your_setting_identifier"])</b>.
  </p>
