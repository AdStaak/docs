  <p class="alert alert-info">
    This module is for developers only. You will need PHP knowledge to utilize this script.

    The <i>Arbitrary Settings</i> module is something of an oddity. Unlike the other
    modules, it doesn't directly DO anything with Form Tools: all it does it let you
    add a section  at the bottom of the Settings -&gt; Main tab, where you can define you own settings for
    storage in the Form Tools database. What do those settings contain and do?
    Anything you want.
  </p>

  <h4>So what's the point?</h4>

  <p>
    The point is to allow you to open up Form Tools to store arbitrary data that you can
    use outside of the script. Maybe an example would help...
  </p>

  <p>
    One of our clients that is using Form Tools to display submission data on their
    site. Every year, they need their custom PHP page to be updating again and again,
    for each year's form ID (and other settings). Each year I manually update the
    form ID on that page, the number of submissions that get displayed on the page and
    other minor little things. Since our client isn't technical, they are unable to do this
    themselves.
  </p>

  <p>
    But now, with this module, they can just edit the values with Form Tools itself:
    which saves <i>us</i> time, and <i>them</i> money. Basically it lets you use Form Tools
    to store "global" data, configurable by the clients through a few simple fields. Then,
    you reference those values in your own PHP files. The result? No more bothersome
    updates...! The client does it themselves.
