  <h3>Configuration Page</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i352.gif" %}

  <p>
    The module configuration page is pretty self-explanatory. Plus it contains a whole thwack of text already in the
    page, so more blurb would be unnecessary. I'll just touch on the key elements here, just so that people browsing
    the module doc can see how it works.
  </p>

  <b>Whitelists vs. Blacklists</b>

  <p>
    After installing the module, select it from your Modules page. There, you will be given the choice to define a
    <b>whitelist</b> or a <b>blacklist</b>.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>A <b>whitelist</b> is a list of <i>permitted</i> IP addresses. Only computers with IP addresses on the list
      will be allowed to log in.</li>
    <li>A <b>blacklist</b> is a list of <i>banned</i> IP addresses. Nobody on the list will be allowed to log in.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    For convenience, your current IP address is listed at the top right of the module page. If you're defining a
    whitelist, you'll probably want to add it!
  </p>

  <b>IP Ranges</b>

  <p>
    As of version 1.0.1 of this module, you can now define a range of IPs, by using the "*" character. For example,
    <b>*.*.*.*</b> would match all IPs; <b>172.*.*.*</b> would only match those IPs that start with 172.
