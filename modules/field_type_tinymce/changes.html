  <h3>Changes from 2.0.6 and earlier</h3>

  <p>
    If you’re installing 2.1.0 or later and haven’t used earlier versions, ignore this
    page. This isn't the page you're looking for - move along, move along.
    For the rest of you, here’s a summary of what's changed.
  </p>

  <h3>Upgraded!</h3>

  <p>
    First of all, the tinyMCE script has been upgraded from the earlier bundled version.
    At the time of writing, we're now using tinyMCE version 3.4.1. By and large, this
    won't mean much in terms of actual functionality, but it's nice to know it's being
    kept up to date.
  </p>

  <h3>Default configuration page</h3>

  <p>
    In 2.0.6 and earlier, you could choose the default configuration of your tinyMCE
    on the Settings -&gt; WYSIWYG page. Now, you'll find those same fields in the Module
    -&gt; TinyMCE module.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you'd grown attached to seeing it in your administrator account's navigation
    menu, no problem! Just go to Settings -&gt; Menus -&gt; Edit Admin Account and add it
    there. But I doubt you will! Generally the WYSIWYG field settings were something
    you'd configure once, then forget about.
  </p>
