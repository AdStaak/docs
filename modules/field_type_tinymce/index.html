  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>
    Up until 2.1.0, Form Tools came with a baked-in WYSIWYG editor. This allowed the
    administrator to choose a rich-text editor for form fields, letting Form Tools users
    edit those field types with all the benefits of rich-text.
  </p>

  <p>
    (A quick aside. In case you didn't already know, WYSIWYG stands for What You See
    Is What You Get - it's a commonly used term for rich-text editors. Moving on!).
  </p>

  <p>
    With Form Tools 2.1.0, the WYSIWYG functionality was extracted and placed in a
    separate module. Partly this was due to the restructuring of the way field types
    are handled; partly it was simply because the WYSIWYG functionality wasn't central
    to the core functionality of the script and lent itself to being in a separate
    module. But placing it in a module also affords the following benefits:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>It's now a lot easier to update since it's independent of the Form Tools
      Core. We can now release quick updates and fixes.</li>
    <li>The tinyMCE is no longer the only possible WYSIWYG field type. Depending on
      user requirements, we can add additional WYSIWYG modules for scripts like
      FCKEditor or htmlarea. Anything goes!</li>
  </ul>
