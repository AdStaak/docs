  <h3>Combining Fields</h3>

  <div class="alert alert-info">
    Note: Phone number fields are now predefined field types in Form Tools 2.1.0. You can 
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/field_types/ft_phone">read about them here!</a> But this example illustrates 
    how you could emulate it manually.
  </div>

  <h4>Combining Form Fields</h4>

  <p>
    A common way to take phone numbers in forms is by separating it into components, like so:
  </p>

  <div>
    (<input type="text" name="phone_1" size="3" value="123" maxlength="3">)
    <input type="text" name="phone_2" size="3" value="456" maxlength="3">
    <input type="text" name="phone_3" size="4" value="7890" maxlength="4">
  </div>

  <p>
    The problem with this is that in the Form Tools UI, each field is displayed separately
    on separate lines. Functionally this is still sound, but it's a bit ugly and hard to read. Instead,
    you can create a pre-parser rule to combine them.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      First, in your Edit Form Â» Database tab, create a new field called just "Phone"
      or something simple, and enter "phone" as the form field name.
    </li>
    <li>Next, add this new field to one of your Views. This is important! Otherwise your new
      field won't show up anywhere in the Form Tools UI.</li>
    <li>Go to the Submission Pre-parser module and add a new rule with the following PHP:

<textarea class="codemirror" data-lang="php">if ( (isset($_POST["phone_1"]) && !empty($_POST["phone_1"])) &&
  (isset($_POST["phone_2"]) && !empty($_POST["phone_2"])) &&
  (isset($_POST["phone_3"]) && !empty($_POST["phone_3"])) ) {
  $_POST["phone"] = "{$_POST["phone_1"]}-{$_POST["phone_2"]}-{$_POST["phone_3"]}";
}</textarea>

    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    And you're done! The three phone form fields (here assumed to have the names "phone_1",
    "phone_2" and "phone_3") are now combined to make a single field, stored in the "phone"
    database field, looking like this:
  </p>

  <div>
    <input type="text" name="phone" value="123-456-7890">
  </div>

  <p>
    For the final touches, you'll probably want to either remove the separate phone fields
    from your View or from the database altogether.
  </p>
