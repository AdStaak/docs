  <h3>Add vs. Update POST values</h3>

  <p>
    This page is only important if you want to add pre-parser rules that will be executed both when the submission is
    first made AND when it's updated via the Form Tools UI.
  </p>

  <p>
    The POST information for <b>adding</b> and <b>updating</b> submissions differs in two ways:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      The $_POST variable from a form will contain the form field names as the keys. For
      submission update requests from the Form Tools UI, the requests will have the database
      column name as the key.
    </li>
    <li>
      Update requests may only contain a subset of the fields. This can
      happen if you group the form submission data into separate tabs.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Workaround #1</h4>

  <p>
    Create two separate rules: one to get executed for ADD requests, another for UPDATE.
    You can do this with a simple boolean test:
  </p>

<textarea class="codemirror" data-lang="php">if ($_POST["form_tools_calling_function"] == "ft_update_submission") {
  // code here
} else {
  // code here
}</textarea>


  <h4>Workaround #2</h4>

  <p>
    Another solution is to update the database column names to match your form field
    names. This isn't a bad idea. For programmers planning on working with the code,
    it's well worth updating the database column names to make them more descriptive.
  </p>

  <p>
    To do this, go to your Edit Form Â» Database tab and click "Smart Fill". This
    will set the database column names to the same as your form field names.
  </p>

  <p class="alert alert-danger">
    Beware! This isn't 100% guaranteed to make the database column names and your form
    fields identical! The Smart Fill script compares your form field names against a list
    of MySQL reserved words, and if there are any matches, generates a DIFFERENT column
    name. Check them over manually.
  </p>
