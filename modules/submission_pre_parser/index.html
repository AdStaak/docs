  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>
    The Submission Pre-Parser module provides a simple UI to add your own PHP to change the incoming POST data before
    it gets added to the database. The module is actually just a visual wrapper for three
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/module_development/hooks">Form Tools hooks</a>: the ones that get executed in the <b>ft_process_form</b>,
    <b>ft_api_process_form</b> and <b>ft_update_submission</b> functions. These are the three main submission insert and
    update functions.
  </p>

  <p>
    There's no reason why you can't utilize these hooks in your own modules, but we found
    that modifying the data prior to submission is such a useful feature, it warranted its
    own module.
  </p>

  <p>
    Modifying and accessing the form data prior to submission has a number of uses, for
    example:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>If you need to group multiple form fields into one for simpler
      presentation in the Form Tools UI (e.g. if your form has a telephone number field
      split into 3 smaller fields).</li>
    <li>The opposite: you need to split a single form field into multiple fields.</li>
    <li>You want to ignore submissions that contain certain values in certain
      fields (e.g. this can be really handy for spam detection)</li>
    <li>You want to execute custom code submissions with particular field values
      (e.g. adding to another database)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The following sections explain the basic usage of the module and include some
    simple examples.
