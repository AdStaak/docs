  <h3>Simple Spam Detection</h3>

  <p>
    One simple use for this module is to add a spam protection layer to your forms. It works by creating fields in
    your form that are hidden with CSS which you know will always be empty IF it was submitted by a real person. Since
    the vast majority of spam is generated by automated scripts, blithely insert values into all form fields based on
    their form field names and labels, they often fill in these hidden fields as well. So, any time a submission
    contains values you.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here's how to detect for this.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>In your form add a hidden field like so:

      <textarea class="codemirror" data-lang="html">
<div style="display:none">
  <input type="text" name="bad_email" value="" />
</div></textarea>

      <div class="alert alert-success">
        Tip: give your input fields as human-friendly, convincing sounding names as possible. Many spam scripts look
        at their name attributes to guess at the sort of content should go there.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      Next, in the Submission Pre-parser module, add a rule with the following PHP:

      <textarea class="codemirror" data-lang="php">if (!empty($_POST["bad_email"])) {
  $_POST["form_tools_ignore_submission"] = true;
}</textarea>

      This will then make Form Tools ignore those submission. This setting gives NO
      indication to the person submitting the form that the submission didn't go through.
      It will look and behaved normally. This is both good and bad: good, because spammers
      checking their automated scripts will assume it worked; bad, because if you accidently
      set this value incorrectly, you may be preventing valid submissions from getting
      through. So be careful - double-check your logic!
    </li>
  </ol>
