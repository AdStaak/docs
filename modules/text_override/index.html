<h3>Text Override</h3>

<p>
  This module lets you change the text for virtually any language string that appears in
  Form Tools. Don't like the term "submission"? Rather user "attendee" or something other
  word that better describes the content? No problem.
</p>


<h4>How it works</h4>

<p>
  All language strings for the Form Tools user interface are pulled from language files
  found in your <b>/global/lang</b> folder. This allows you to display the interface in any
  language that you want, provided a language file exists. For a full list of the available
  languages, see the <a href="http://translations.formtools.org">translations section</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Language files consist of one giant PHP array, with a unique "key" for each language string. For example:
</p>


<textarea class="codemirror" data-lang="php">// ...
$LANG["word_about"] = "About";
$LANG["word_accept"] = "Accept";
$LANG["word_access"] = "Access";
// ...</textarea>

<p>
  Here, the "word_about", "word_accept" and "word_access" are the keys. They uniquely
  identify the string and are used throughout the code and templates to display that
  particular string.
</p>

<p>
  This module intercepts individual keys in the $LANG array and overrides them before
  they gets outputted to the page.
</p>

<h4>Why not just edit the language file?</h4>

<p>
  Any time you upgrade, the language file contents may have been changed. So, any changes
  you make to them are going to be overwritten any time you upgrade. This module is
  compatible with upgrading.
</p>

<h4>Limitations / Restrictions</h4>

<p>
  It's not a perfect solution, but it can still help in a lot of cases. Here's a
  few limitations:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>It's not multi-language friendly. If you have users using different language packs
    it will override the strings for EVERY language.</li>
  <li>It doesn't affect individual modules pack string: only strings found in the Core
    language file.</li>
  <li>Form Tools strings are often used in multiple places. So if you override a string
    like "SELECT", bear in mind it is a GLOBAL change: it will override the string for
    everywhere in the UI that the string appears.
  </li>
</ul>
