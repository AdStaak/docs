  <h3>Custom login forms</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i87.jpg" %}

  <p>
    The built-in login form is fine for some situations, but you may find it more convenient
    for your users to embed a login form within your own pages. This can often improve
    usability.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Submission Accounts module auto-generates custom login forms for your configured
    forms. The HTML it generates is very basic: no CSS markup; just plain HTML tags &amp; labels
    - so you'll probably want to edit the generated content to fit it into your page.
  </p>

  <p>
    To generate the custom login form, just select the form from the main Submission Accounts
    page and click on the Custom Login tab. There, select the appropriate checkboxes to
    generate the HTML.
  </p>

  <h4>Error Redirects</h4>

  <p>
    If you use a custom login form, you may want to redirect the user to a specific page if
    they fail to login properly. By default, the user just gets directed to the default login
    page which displays the error.
  </p>

  <p>
    To redirect to a custom page, just include the following hidden field in your form:
  </p>

  <textarea class="codemirror" data-lang="html"><input type="hidden" name="invalid_login_redirect_url" value="http://www.yoursite.com" /></textarea>

  <p>
    Make sure "http://www.yoursite.com" is the appropriate URL. Then, all failed login
    attempts will be redirected to that URL with an additional error message flag passed
    in the query string. The possible query string values are:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>no_form_id</li>
    <li>no_username</li>
    <li>no_password</li>
    <li>invalid_form_id</li>
    <li>form_inactive</li>
    <li>login_incorrect</li>
  </ul>
