  <h3>Configure a new form</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i94.gif" %}

  <p>
    After <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/modules/installing">installing the module</a>, select it on the Modules page in the admin
    UI and click on the "Configure New Form" button found on the main Submission Accounts page. This is shown in the
    screenshot to the right.
  </p>

  <p>
    The page that you are redirected to lets you configure the Submission Accounts module with one of your forms. Note
    that you can only configure each form ONCE. The next time you try to configure a form you'll notice that the form
    you previously configured is no longer available as a select option.
  </p>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i92.gif" align="left" %}

  <p>
    The Configure New Form page should look something like the screenshot to the left. This
    page contains the main configuration settings for setting up the Submission Account.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's review each setting one by one.
  </p>

  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">
    <tbody><tr>
      <td width="160" class="blue" valign="top">Form</td>
      <td>
        This lets you choose which form for which you'd like those users to be able to
        log in and edit their submissions.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="160" class="blue" valign="top">View</td>
      <td>
        This is an important setting! Views let you create custom subsets of the form data
        including choosing which form fields should be displayed, how they're grouped (tabs)
        and which fields are editable. Submission Accounts are associated with a View. This
        provides you with enormous control over the appearance of the UI for the user who
        logs in to view / edit his form submissions. Information like their IP address,
        submission date, last modified date and submission ID may not be pertinent - so you
        may wish to create a custom View that contains only those fields you want.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Theme</td>
      <td>
        This is another powerful setting. Like the previous View setting, this lets you
        customize the appearance of the login page and backend pages for the user logging
        in. Depending on your requirements, you may feel it worthwhile to develop a theme
        that matches your website design so that logging in and editing the submission will
        be a smooth transition from the public side to the backend. You can read more about
        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/theme_development/">theme development here</a>.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Email Field</td>
      <td>
        This setting is optional, but recommended. It rather depends on whether your form
        contains an email field for the user or not. If you can select the email field here,
        you are given the option of including a "Forgot your password?" link on the login
        page that sends an email reminder to the user.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Username Field</td>
      <td>
        This setting is required! You need to identify a field that will identify
        the user. The simplest solution - for both you and the user - is to specify
        the email field here. People generally don't forget their own email addresses,
        whereas usernames come and go. Also, this field does NOT have to be unique. The
        Submission Accounts login script identifies the users by the username + password
        combination, not just the username. So technically, you can have multiple (different)
        users that use the same username.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="blue" valign="top">Password Field</td>
      <td>
        Most forms don't contain a "password" field, but the Submission Accounts module
        requires it. If you already have a password field in your form, you're rosy. You
        don't need to read on. If not, here's some potential solutions:
        <ul>
          <li>The first, simplest solution is to just add a new password field to your form
            which the user can fill in when they first submit the form. Don't forget that
            you'll need to add this to Form Tools for storage as well. New fields are added
            via the Edit Form Â» Database tab, which you
            <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/form_management/adding_form_fields">read about here</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            A second option is to include a hidden field in your form, containing a default
            password which the users can use to log in for the first time. Bear in mind that
            this isn't very secure: people can figure this out by viewing the form source,
            and potentially gaining access to their information before they log in themselves
            and update the password. Plus there's no guarantee that the user will change the
            password having logged in. But depending on your situation - e.g. if you're
            processing forms in a local or password protected environment, this may be
            a legitimate solution.
          </li>
          <li>
            A third option is to use the Submission Pre-Parser module to automatically
            generate a random password for the user when they first register and email it
            to them. This solution requires a little PHP knowledge. You can learn more about
            the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/submission_pre_parser/">Submission Pre-Parser</a> module here.
          </li>
        </ul>

  <p><b>View Override Settings</b></p>

  <p>
    The last section on the page is entitled "View Override Settings". This was added in
    version <b>1.1.0</b>. What it does is allow you to use a different View for a submission
    depending on the values in that submission. This is a convenient way to show different
    information to a user depending on their form values.
  </p>

  <p>
    It works very simply: you just pick the form field that you want to base the rule on,
    then choose the values that it contains. Finally, in the third column, specify the View
    that should be used to display the data IF the previous condition is met. And that's it!
  </p>

  <p>
    There are a few more things to note:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>You can define as many rules as you want, but the order is important. The FIRST
      View rule that meets the criteria for a submission is the one that's used to display to
      the user.</li>
    <li>If none of the rules are met for a submission, it uses the default View.</li>
    <li>If the user themselves changes a field value that you have specified in the
      View Override section, they will automatically see the new View.</li>
    <li>To specify multiple values for a rule, just enter them with a pipe (|) delimiter,
      e.g. "Arts|Humanities|Sciences".</li>
  </ul>
