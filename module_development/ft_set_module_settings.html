	<p>
		This function abstracts away all the details of storing settings for your module in
		the <b>settings</b> database table. It takes a single parameter: a hash of key-value
		pairs where the key is the setting name and the value, the setting value.
	</p>

	<p>
		Imagine you want to store two pieces of information supplied by the user: their age
		and name. You could store this information in the database like so:
	</p>

{% highlight php startinline %}
$info = array("name" => $name, "age" => $age);
ft_set_module_settings($info);
{% endhighlight %}

	<p>
		And that's it! It's now stored in the database. If the value didn't already exist in
		the database it will be added. If it <b>did</b> already exist, the values will be
		updated.
	</p>
