	<p>
		Here's a few solutions to problems and scenarios likely to be encountered. Feel free to edit this page with more.
	</p>

	<h3>Displaying information in tabs</h3>

	<p>
		Tabs are a very nice way to group related data and avoid "information overload" - showing too much on the page
		at once, which can be overwhelming for the user.
	</p>

	<p>
		All Form Tools themes provide some sort of presentation for tabs. Precisely how it appears it up to the theme
		developer, but generally they're all rendered as tab-like structures.
	</p>

	<p>
		See the <a href="https://docs.formtools.org/modules/hello_tabs/">Hello Tabs!</a> example module for a simple illustration of how to
		implement tabs into your module. Basically it works by passing a special <b>$tabs</b> variable to the
		template, then calling the tabset_open.tpl and tabset_close.tpl templates in your template. They do the
		job of rendering the tab information that you passed to it.
	</p>

	<h3>Displaying pagination</h3>

	<p>
		Often you may have too much information to display on a single page, and need to add some simple pagination
		links (&laquo; 1 2 3 ...) to let the user see the information a page at a time.
		Form Tools comes with two different mechanisms to allow for this: DHTML pagination and regular server-side navigation.
	</p>

	<h4>pagination.tpl</h4>

	{% codemirror php %}
$page_vars["pagination"] = ft_get_page_nav($num_results, $num_pages_per_page, $page, "");
	{% endcodemirror %}



{% include close_section.html %}
