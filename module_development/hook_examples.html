	<h3>Code Hook Example</h3>

	<p>
		Let's register a <b>code</b> hook for a fictitious module named "My Module", found
		in a "my_module" folder. The purpose is to execute out own PHP code when a certain
		event happends in the code. Here's how we register the hook:
	</p>

{% codemirror php %}
ft_register_hook("code", "my_module", "start", "ft_process_form", "my_hook", 50);
{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		This line registers the code hook for the function <b>ft_process_form</b>; it tells it to
		call the <b>my_hook</b> function at the "start" location in the function. The
		priority is set to 50 (out of 1-100). The priority determines the order in which the hook
		should get executed if there are multiple hooks assigned to the same hook.
	</p>

	<p>
		As mentioned earlier, this line can be placed in your module's installation function, or
		called at some point in your module pages based on user input.
	</p>

	<p>
		Now let's look at the <b>my_hook</b> function. This function MUST be located in your
		module's <a href="/module_development/file_library/">library.php file</a> - or included by
		that file. When hooks are processed, they are looked for at that location. If it can't be found, the
		hook is ignored.
	</p>

	<p>
		Code hook functions should always accept a single parameter: a hash (associative array)
		containing whatever information is passed by that particular function.
	</p>

{% codemirror php %}
function my_hook($vars)
{
  // $vars always contains the form_tools_overridable_vars key: an array of variable names that
  // can be overwritten by your hook for this particular core function. Some core functions
  // don't allow any values to be overwritten, so this will be empty
  print_r($vars["form_tools_overridable_vars"]);

  // this key always contains the name of the core function that is calling your hook
  echo $vars["form_tools_calling_function"];

  // return values
  $info = array();
  $info["name"] = "Overridden!";
  return $info;
}
{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		The comments should explain quite a bit. The two keys, <b>form_tools_overridable_vars</b>
		and <b>form_tools_calling_function</b> are always passed to the function. The calling
		function can be handy if you need your hook has been registered to multiple core functions
		and you'd like it to behave differently based on the context. The
		<b>form_tools_overridable_vars</b> key contains an array of the names of variables that
		can be overridden. To override them, just make your function return a hash with those values
		as keys. Any other values in that hash will be ignored. If the value isn't overridden, the
		core function will continue ordinary processing.
	</p>

	<p>
		For more information about the meaning of each variable, you'll need to look at the core
		function.
	</p>

	<h3>Template Hook Example</h3>

	<p>
		Now let's register a template hook, to insert some HTML into one of the places in the
		Form Tools pages. Here's our register function:
	</p>

{% codemirror php %}
ft_register_hook("template", "my_module", "edit_client_main_top", "", "say_hello", 50);
{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		Like with the code hook register function calls, this line would usually be added to
		your module's installation script, so that the hook gets registered once when the module
		is first installed.
	</p>
	<p>
		This line of code registers the <b>template</b> hook for the <b>my_module</b> function, to
		be called at the <b>edit_client_main_top</b> location in the templates. In order words,
		it'll be called wherever you find this line in one of the templates:
	</p>

{% codemirror smarty %}
{template_hook location="admin_edit_client_main_top"}
{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		(This happens to be in the /themes/default/admin/clients/tab_main.tpl template file).
	</p>

	<p>
		Lastly, it tells the script to call the say_hello() PHP function, and gives it a priority
		of 50 (from 1-100, where 1 is top priority). Here's what the say_hello function would
		look like. All template hook functions should take two parameters:
	</p>


{% codemirror php %}
/**
 * Our template hook function.
 *
 * @param string $location the name of the template hook (i.e. the value of the "location"
 *   attribute of the template hook, found in the Smarty template)
 * @param array $info a giant array containing all the data available to the template. This
 *   will contain whatever information you need, but you'll have to hunt for it.
 */
function say_hello($location, $info)
{
  echo "hello!";
}
{% endcodemirror %}

{% include close_section.html %}
