	<p>
		You can choose to include contain three specially named functions that are automatically recognized and processed
		by the Core script: the <strong>installation</strong>, <strong>uninstallation</strong> and
		<strong>upgrade</strong> script. These allow standardized integration
		with the Form Tools script so that when the user performs one of those tasks, you can execute whatever code
		you need.
	</p>
	<p>
		All three functions are optional. For simple modules, you may find you don't need any.
	</p>

	<p>
		N.B. Your core module code can be procedural or object-oriented; it doesn't matter. However, these three
		must be functions. If you wrap it in a class or rename it, the code won't be executed.
	</p>

	<h4>Where are they located?</h4>

	<p>
		You can place these functions anywhere you want, but they <strong>must</strong> be included in your
		<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/module_development/file_library/">library.php</a> file.
	</p>
