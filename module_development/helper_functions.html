	<p>
		Form Tools comes with a number of functions to simplify the job of writing your module.
		It's well worth glancing over the following functions just to see what functionality is
		available so that you don't end up writing duplicate code.
	</p>

	<p>
		One thing to mention before getting started: the module folder names have special meaning
		within Form Tools. Since the module names themselves are translated based on the users
		language, and the module ID DB value may be different for the same module between two
		different installations, the majority of these functions below use the folder name to
		uniquely identify the module. So "pages" refers to the Pages module, "export_manager"
		refers to the Export Manager module and so on. These module folder names act as the
		modules namespace (both in terms of the files and referencing the code) and should not
		be renamed by administrators. So as a developer, you can make the assumption that the
		module folder names are consistent across all installations. So, for example, if you
		use the <b>ft_check_module_enabled</b> and <b>ft_include_modules</b> function to import
		the Pages module, this is perfectly valid and encouraged:
	</p>

	{% codemirror php %}
if (ft_check_module_enabled("pages")) {
    ft_include_modules("pages");
}
	{% endcodemirror %}
