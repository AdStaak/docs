	<p>
		One of the many nice things about using Smarty templates is that you can abstract away logic and content into
        separate libraries, saving you having to write duplicate code and helping you keep the template clean and
        uncluttered. It helps your templates stay focused as possible on what it <b>should</b> be handling: the appearance
		and presentation of the data and not the logic.
	</p>

	<p>
		For example, say you need to display a "Province/State" dropdown on multiple pages in your module. First, you
        can write separate PHP function to generate the HTML content, then second, you can write a separate Smarty
        function file to use that PHP that can be called directly in your templates like so:
	</p>

	{% codemirror smarty %}
{state_dropdown default=$default_state}
	{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		All your Smarty functions and modifiers belong in the /smarty_plugins subfolder of your module
		folder. By defining them there, they are automatically accessible to your template
		pages within your module pages.
