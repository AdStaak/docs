	<p>
		For practical examples of how hooks can be employed, see the following modules:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<a href="https://docs.formtools.org/modules/submission_pre_parser/">Submission Pre-Parser module</a>.
			At its core, it's fundamentally just a visual wrapper for writing your own code hooks.
			It registers a single code hook for each of the <b>ft_process_form</b>,
			<b>ft_api_process_form</b> and <b>ft_update_submission</b> functions. When those functions
			are executed, the module processes each and every "rule" (i.e. PHP code) that has been
			added through the UI.</li>
		<li><a href="https://docs.formtools.org/modules/extended_client_fields">Extended Client Fields module</a>.
			This module uses both code and template hooks to insert new fields into the edit client
			pages - both administrator and client - which are saved to the database by attaching
			custom events to the functions that get called when the form is updated. If you want a
			good example of how to combine the two hook types, this is a good place to look!
		</li>
	</ol>
