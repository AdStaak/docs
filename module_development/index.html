	<p>
		Want to write a Form Tools module? Awesome! There's an awful lot of information in this section, but we do
		recommend slogging your way through the whole thing. Even if you don't catch all the details it will still
		give you a sense of how it works and what exists to make your life easier. It won't be time wasted, honest.
	</p>

	<h4>Overview</h4>

	<p>
		No script with the scope of Form Tools can accommodate all functionality requests without becoming bloated
		and unusable. To prevent this, many larger scripts turn to some form of module / plugin architecture that keeps
		the core code small, but still allows for extensibility. Form Tools is one of those scripts. Developers can
		extend the core functionality in whatever way they need without needing to tamper with the core script.
	</p>

	<p>
		The modules were structured with the following goals in mind:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Simple to install and remove</b>. This is paramount. To make modules as useful as possible,
			they have to be easy to install. Regardless of a users' technical proficiency, nobody like fussing
			around with complicated installation instructions. If it's tough to install, people are going to give
			up, and they're likely to make mistakes - potentially causing the main script to stop working.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Consistent</b>. Consistency is king. Modules have to be consistent in terms of the overall
			UI to make it look similar to the core code so that the user doesn't have to re-learn the interface for each
			and every module; consistent so that all modules can be translated to other languages; consistent in the way the
			information is stored in the database.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>International</b>. All modules need to be able to support multiple languages.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Simple to develop and write</b>. Let's not forget the poor developer here! If a module isn't easy to write,
			no-one's going to want to do it.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		We've developed a modular system to allow you, the developer, to add you own functionality
		that are compatible with the above rules - just by following the required module structure.
	</p>

	<p>
		Lastly, one quick disclaimer: it's not perfect! Depending on what your module does, it may still involve editing
		some of the core pages. But by and large, it's not a bad approach. Depending on user feedback, this overall design
		may be revised sometime in the future, but for now - let's get started!
