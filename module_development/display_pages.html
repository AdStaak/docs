	<h3>Smarty Templates</h3>

	<p>
		All HTML rendered within Form Tools - the theme pages, modules, emails, everything - is done
		with <a href="http://smarty.net/" target="_blank">Smarty</a>. For our usage, Smarty templates are just
		HTML files with a .tpl extension, that contain special Smarty logic which process variables passed to
		the template.
	</p>

	<p>
		Smarty templates are called from your PHP using the <b>ft_display_module_page</b> helper function. This
		function abstracts away all the fussy details, providing your templates with a wide range of information
		about the environment, user, sessions and so forth. To understand how the Smarty templates are rendered,
		I'd recommend reading these sections:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/module_development/file_index/">Anatomy of a Module: index.php</a></li>
		<li><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/module_development/ft_display_module_page/">Helper Functions: ft_display_module_page()</a></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Themes and CSS</h3>

	<p>
		Each theme can render the UI in any number of ways. But theme developers only ever edit the templates, CSS
		and Javascript within their own theme folder. It would be unrealistic to expect them to edit the presentation
		layer for all modules, too. So to account for this, <b>module pages are rendered within a module wrapper
		defined by the theme designer</b>. This is actually very simple. All your templates should include the
		<b>modules_header.tpl</b> and <b>modules_footer.tpl</b> files, like so:
	</p>

	{% codemirror smarty %}
{include file='modules_header.tpl'}

Your HTML here.

{include file='modules_footer.tpl'}
	{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		It's the theme designers job to develop that wrapper so that your HTML appears in the appropriate spot.
	</p>

	<p>
		Now, since every theme presents the information in different ways, you need to keep this in mind when writing
		your HTML. NEVER rely on CSS defined in your theme folder: that's custom to that particular theme and probably
		won't exist for others.
	</p>

	<p>
		The CSS rules you can rely on being available are stored in your <b>/global css/main.css</b> file. These
		rules are imported for all themes so you can rely on them being there.
	</p>

	<p>
		You can, of course, defined your own stylesheets to contain whatever CSS you wish. If you do, we strongly
		recommend keeping things simple and generic to increase the likelihood of being visually compatible with
		whatever theme is selected by the administrator.
	</p>

	<h3>Language Compatibility</h3>

	<p>
		As mentioned in the discussion of the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/module_development/file_lang/">module
		language files</a>, Form Tools modules are designed support multiple languages. The way this works is
		actually quite simple: all language strings that appear in the user interface and code
		are stored in a separate language file. This is a PHP file, located in the module's
		<b>/lang</b> folder. Every time a page is rendered, it automatically loads the
		appropriate language file for use in your code.
	</p>

	<p>
		But extracting the strings into your language file is only half the battle. Here's a
		few other things to keep in mind. This list is FAR from complete and will be expanded
		upon in later versions of the doc.
	</p>


	<h4>Spacing</h4>

	<p>
		This is very obvious, but it's easy to forget: just because a word is short in English,
		doesn't mean it's going to be short in other languages. Try to keep this in mind when
		developing your templates. Rather than using fixed widths for table columns, you might
		want to consider adding a "nowrap" class and padding to the string so the text doesn't
		get jammed up together. That way, the templates stay fairly flexible and can accomodate
		strings of different lengths.
	</p>

	<h4>Language Strings Placeholders</h4>

	<p>
		Often you may need to embed something dynamic within a string. e.g. "You have X
		settings to complete". In different languages, "X" may appear in different places
		so you can't simply separate the string into two ("You have" and "settings to complete")
		then construct your string by concatenating the values.
	</p>

	<p>
		Instead, embed Smarty variables into your strings. Here's how it works. First, in your
		language file, add your string like so:
	</p>

	{% codemirror php %}
$L["phrase_num_settings_to_complete"] = "You have {\$num_settings} settings to complete.";
	{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		Note that the <b>$</b> in <b>$num_settings</b> is escaped with a preceding \ dash. This
		prevents it being interpreted as PHP.
	</p>

	<p>
		Next, in your PHP you can use the Form Tools core function <b>ft_eval_smarty_string</b>
		&nbsp;to replace the Smarty variable <b>$num_settings</b> with the value you need to insert.
	</p>

	{% codemirror php startinline %}
$placeholders = array("num_settings" => 5);
$string = ft_eval_smarty_string($L["phrase_num_settings_to_complete"], $placeholders)
echo $string; // "You have 5 settings to complete."
	{% endcodemirror %}
