	<p>
		There are two main pages for viewing and editing your form submission data: the <i>Submission Listing</i> page,
        and the <i>Edit Submission</i> page. Administrator and clients accounts both see these two pages, with a few
        small differences between them.
	</p>

	<p>
		This page is an overview to the features on the Submission Listing page. The following
		pages in this documentation section go into some of the features in more depth.
	</p>

	<div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Heading</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            {% include screenshot.html item="i268.gif" %}
            The form submissions page always contains the name of your form so you never lose
            track of what you're currently viewing. Clicking the icon or the "Forms" link
            returns you to the main form listing page where you can choose another form.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Edit Form / View Submissions toggle</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            {% include screenshot.html item="i269.gif" %}
            This appears for the administrator only; when you click it you toggle between
            editing the submissions and editing the form. It's "smart" in that it redirects you
            back to the last Edit Form page you were currently viewing (e.g. the Views tab);
            similarly it takes you back to the last edited submission or Submission Listing page.

            When you're in the midst of configuring your form, this can be an extremely useful tool for confirming that
            your changes are having the effect you expect.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Search Form</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            {% include screenshot.html item="i270.gif" %}
            The search form appears above the submission list, providing some basic search options to find the submission(s)
            you're interested in. As with all other aspects of the UI, it's customized to your particular form: it allows
            you to search specific fields within your form.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Show All button</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            {% include screenshot.html item="i271.gif" %}
            The Show All button is useful when you've just performed a search that returns a subset
            of the total submissions in the form. If you are viewing a subset it becomes bold and clicking it shows
            all submissions, emptying your current search criteria.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Pagination Links</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            {% include screenshot.html item="i59.jpg" %}
            The pagination links and "total results" line provide you with a little information about the
            current set of submissions being viewed and the option to navigate between the pages.
            Note that this section always reflects both the current <b>search</b> values and the
            current <b>View</b>. So the "Total Results" value may be different from View to View.
            Hopefully this should work fairly intuitively.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Views Dropdown</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            {% include screenshot.html item="i272.gif" %}
            The Views dropdown is an exciting addition in Form Tools 2. If you have more than one
            View the account has permission to see it, you will see a dropdown
            containing the list of Views. When you select the View, it will automatically load the
            View. Views may contain any subset of fields and submissions, they can contain different
            columns on the submission listings page, can group the submission fields in tabs on the
            "Edit Submission" page, and much more. See the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/views">Views</a> section
            for a more thorough discussion of the features.<br>
            <br>
            One final note: the default View loaded by any client account is the FIRST View in the
            ordered set of Views that they have permissions to access.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Quicklinks bar</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            {% include screenshot.html item="i273.gif" %}
            Form Tools 2 allows modules to add quicklink icons to this location. This can be
            convenient, depending on what the module is doing. In this case, the
            <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/report_builder/">Report Builder</a> module
            has added a quicklink icon so that you can view all the reports, just by clicking its
            quicklink.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Table Columns</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            All the columns you see in this page can be specified on the
            <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/views/columns_tab">Edit View &raquo; Columns tab</a>. The point of the
            submissions table is to provide a quick overview of the data, showing a subset of
            relevant fields so that you can quickly find the field, then click on the edit icon to
            see the full data.
            <br>
            Tip: if your column (i.e. form field!) contains numeric values and you want to make it a
            sortable column, you may find that it sorts incorrectly. To remedy this, go to the
            Edit Form » Database tab, locate the field and change the "Data Type" value to
            "Number". That will tell the sorting mechanism to treat the field as a number.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Num Rows selected text</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            {% include screenshot.html item="i63.jpg" %}
            This label keeps track of the number of currently selected rows. Unlike Form Tools
            1.x, you can now go from page to page selecting rows on each: the system will remember
            which fields you have selected so that when you return to each page, you'll see
            the current selected rows. The "num rows selected" text keeps you reminded of how many
            rows selected.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Mass Select/Unselect Options</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            {% include screenshot.html item="i67.jpg" %}
            These buttons provide a convenient way to select and unselect submissions. The buttons
            are also "smart" in that they know whether or not you're viewing a set of results shown
            on a single page or multiple pages. As such, if you're on a single page and click the
            "Select All" button it will select all rows and the button text will change to "All
            X results selected". If there were multiple pages, it would select all submissions
            on the page then the label would change to say "Select all XX results" where XX is the
            total number of results in the current result set. So in other words, it has only
            selected all the submissions on the current page - not every submission in the result set.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Delete button</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            {% include screenshot.html item="i275.gif" %}
            The delete button only appears if the View allows you to delete submissions. This option
            is set in the Edit Form » Views » Edit View » main tab, under the
            option "May delete submissions". Clicking the delete
            button deletes ALL selected submissions. So be very careful you've selected the right
            ones!
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Add button</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            {% include screenshot.html item="i274.gif" %}
            The Add button only appears if the View allows you to add submissions. This option
            is set in the Edit Form » Views » Edit View » main tab, under the
            option "May add submissions".
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Export options</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            {% include screenshot.html item="i276.gif" %}
            This bit's neat! I personally think it's one of the best features of Form Tools 2.
            All the export options you see at the bottom of the page are handled by the new Export
            Manager module. This gives you complete control over the way you can generate, view and
            download the data. See the following page for more information on this great feature.
