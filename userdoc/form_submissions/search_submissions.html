	<p>
		Back when Form Tools 1.4.4 was introduced - back in the late paleolithic era - a new
		search bar appeared at the top of the submission listings page for clients and
		administrators. It provides you with a simple but powerful tool for searching your form
		submissions.
	</p>

	<h4>Changes from 2.0.x</h4>

	<p>
		2.1.0 introduced a few improvements to the search bar.
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li><b>Hiding the search bar</b>. Depending on your data set, sometimes you simply
			don't <i>need</i> the search functionality - it's rare, but it can happen. Or, perhaps
			you are charging client access to the script and want to limit functionality based on
			a subscription model. To hide the search bar altogether, simply
			uncheck all "Searchable" checkboxes for the fields in the View (under Edit Form -&gt;
			Views tab -&gt; Edit View -&gt; Fields sub-tab). The page will automatically recognize that
			there are no searchable fields and hide the search bar.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Date fields</b>.
			Secondly, the way the search bar handles date fields has changed. In 2.1.0, the Date
			field type is a first class citizen. The Core Submission Date and Last Modified Date
			fields are no longer the only fields that may utilize the javascript datepicker. Now
			you can set ANY of your form fields to be date fields. As such, when you select any
			form field that's set to a Date, it now shows a Select Date / Date Range field. The
			old date range dropdown in 2.0.x has been removed in favour of this. When you click
			on the Date Range field, a javascript dropdown will appear listing various search
			options. You may use the functionality there to search by individual dates, pre-set
			date ranges or specific date ranges. It's very powerful, and very easy to use!
		</li>
	</ol>


	<h4>Available Search Options</h4>

	<p>
		The first dropdown box in the search bar contains the various database fields you
		can search. The actual fields that appear in that dropdown depend on your current View.
		It only lets you search fields in the current View that are marked as "Searchable". The
		options can be grouped into the following:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>All fields: lets you search the entire database for a specific keyword.</li>
		<li>Custom field: lets you search for a string in a single form field. All of your
			searchable View fields are listed.</li>

		<li>Date / Last Modified: this option, when selected, pops open an additional dropdown
			menu containing the search-by-date options. The new dropdown option contains various
			options such as "Last day", "Last week" and "Last Month" as well as a search-by-month
			option. If you are running Form Tools on a slow server and/or have a extremely high
			volume of submissions in your form, you can use the search-by-month option to export
			the data on a monthly basis, rather than all at once - which can sometimes cause server
			timeouts. The "specific months" section lists the last 12 months starting with the
			current month. If the earliest submission in your form was 3 months ago, you will
			only see three months listed - no more.</li>
		<li>IP Address: this is handy way to quickly locate all submissions made by a single
			user.</li>
	</ul>


	<h4>Search Tips</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>Enter a SINGLE search keyword. Multiple words will be regarded as a single string,
			making it less likely you'll find a match.</li>
		<li>To reset the form submission listings page to its default sort order, listing all
			submissions, click the "Show All" button at any time. If your current result set doesn't
			contain all the items (e.g. you did a search for "Phil" which returns 4 of the 14
			total submissions), the "Show All" button becomes bold. This serves as a visual aid to
			&nbsp;remind you you're not viewing all the submissions made through the form.</li>
	</ul>
