	<h3>Adding Internal Forms</h3>

	{% include screenshot.html item='i208.jpg' %}

	<p>
		To add an Internal form, just click on the Add Form link in the left navigation menu. There, select the Internal
        form. That will open up a page where you create your new Internal form.
	</p>

	<p>
		The options are this page are very basic: you just enter the form name, how many fields it should have, and
        what permissions it should have (admin only, public or private). And don't worry! All these settings can be
        changed later.
	</p>


	{% include screenshot.html item='i209.jpg' %}

	<p>
		Lastly, click the "Add form" button. That's it! You now have a blank form created which you can start adding
        data through. That took, what... 10 whole seconds?
	</p>

	<div class="clear"></div>

	<h3>So now what?</h3>

	<p>
		Next you'll want to configure the form to store the information you want. What I'd do is click on the toggle
        icon at the top right of the screen (it's grey and has two icons side-by-side). That icon lets you switch
        between <i>editing</i> the form and <i>viewing</i> the form data. It's a very convenient way to toggle back and
		forth to see how the changes you're making to the form configuration is being reflected when editing your form
        submissions.
	</p>

	<p>
		On the Submission Listing page, click "Add" to add a new submission to your form, then click "back to search
        results". That gives you an idea of what data is currently being stored. What you'll want to do now is click the
        toggle icon again, and go to the Edit Form -&gt; Fields tab. There, change the field names and field types to
        customize what data your form is storing. Just keep experimenting. At this stage, your form doesn't have any data,
		so you can add and delete fields without having to worry about losing any existing submission data. Play around
        with it! If you get stuck on anything, give <a href="../editing_forms">this section</a> a read over. It explains
        what all the various options are when editing your forms.
	</p>

    <p class="alert alert-info">
        <b>Tip!</b> This is mentioned ad nauseum elsewhere, but when you add fields to the Edit Form &raquo; Fields tab,
        they won't automatically appear when viewing the form submissions. <i>Why?!</i> Flexibility! When you're
        viewing a form submission you're actually looking at a "View" of the form. So you'll need to add the field to
        the View as well. Read more about <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/views">Views here</a>. This is important
        to understand.
