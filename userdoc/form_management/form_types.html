		There are two types of forms in Form Tools: <i>Internal</i> and <i>External</i>.
		When you click on the "Add Form" link in the menu, it will direct you to a page where you need to choose one of the
		following types. Here's what each type means:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><i>Internal forms</i> are created within Form Tools and are only found there - not
			elsewhere on your site. Only Form Tools user accounts will have access to the form. You
			create and configure the form directly through the interface.</li>
		<li><i>External forms</i> are forms that already exist on your website, or somewhere on
			the web. Up until Form Tools 2.1.0, all forms were external.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Note: you can change a form from External to Internal and back again. Choosing a
		particular form type doesnâ€™t box you in down the road.
