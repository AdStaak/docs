	<p>
		The final step is just for finalizing your form: pushing it into "live" mode. This tells
		Form Tools to start storing the submissions. What you need to do depends on the submission
		type: <b>direct</b> or <b>code</b> via the API. Both are quite simple.
	</p>

	<h4>Direct Submissions</h4>

	<p>
		Return to your form and remove the following hidden field:
	</p>

	{% codemirror html %}
<input type="hidden" name="form_tools_initialize_form" value="1" />
	{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		Now refresh your form page. Going forward, submissions should now be stored in Form Tools.
	</p>

	<h4>Code Submissions (API)</h4>

	<p>
		Change the <b>ft_api_init_form_page</b> line on the first page of your form to whatever
		line is displayed in the Add Form Step 6 page. It will looks something like this, except
		the X will be your form number.
	</p>

{% codemirror php %}
$fields = ft_api_init_form_page(X);
{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		Then visit your "thank you" page to empty the sessions. Once this is done, all new form
		submissions will be processed and stored by the program.
	</p>

	<p>
		And you're done! Congratulations, you've finished configuring your form!
	</p>
