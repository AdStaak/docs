		For whatever reason, you may find it useful to temporarily disable a form. To do this, edit
		the form and go to the Main tab. There, change the "Status" setting to "offline". This will
		prevent any future submissions from being stored by Form Tools. If a person submits the form
		during this time, they will receive a message informing them that the form has been
		disabled. As such, you may wish to make additional changes to the form itself to indicate
		it has been disabled.
