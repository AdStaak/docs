	<h4>Overview</h4>

	{% include screenshot.html item='i265.gif' %}

	<p>
		The power and flexibility of Form Tools is in its interface for managing your forms.
		There, you can add new forms for storage, modify existing forms, add and remove form
		fields, add and change multi-select field options like radio and dropdown
		boxes, specify locations on your server where files should be uploaded to, create any
		number of emails to be sent based on certain event triggers, define ways to subdivide
		and organize your form submissions, change the database column names
		themselves and much, much more.
	</p>

	<h4>Integrating your forms</h4>
	<p>
		Form Tools can store submission data from forms from any location. If you chose to, you
		could install the program on your website then use it to store form submissions from
		multiple client websites. And since you can specify the redirect URL for each form
		(i.e. where the user gets sent after submitting a form), you can redirect each user
		back to the appropriate website in a seamless transaction. If need be, you can
		specify form field data to get passed back through the query string - allowing
		"receipt" or "thankyou" pages to display personal information, e.g. "Thanks for
		submitting the form, John!"
	</p>

	<p>
		Form Tools is compatible with multi-page forms and can process form submissions
		in two ways: a "direct" submission, in which the form submits the data directly to
		a file called <b>process.php</b>, found in the root Form Tools folder. Or secondly,
		the submissions can be submitted through the API. The API is a set of functions
		for things like adding submissions to the database and displaying the data in your
		webpages. Generally speaking, using the API is a better approach: it provides FAR
		more control and is designed for things like multi-page forms, adding CAPTCHAs to
		your forms, displaying images as they are uploaded through the form, handling
		integration with online payment gateways and more. But this additional functionality
		makes it more complicated: so you may well wish to stick with the simpler "direct"
		approach, depending on your needs.
	</p>

		The following pages explains all of the subjects mentioned in brief above, hopefully
		answering the majority of your questions. If you can't find the answer to your question
		here in the user doc, <a href="http://forums.formtools.org">just post it in our forums!</a>
