	<p>
		The test submission page is where your form first makes contact with Form Tools. It works
		by waiting for a submission sent from your form that contains all the fields
		you want stored. Form Tools then uses this to build a custom database table to house all
		future form submissions. There are a lot of benefits to building the database table this
		way, including: reducing the likelihood of errors for entering form field names,
		reducing the amount of configuration required and ensuring that your form and Form Tools are
		correctly connected.
	</p>

	<p>
		Exactly how this page looks again depends on the submission method you picked on step 1.
	</p>

	<h3>Test Submission: Direct / POST forms</h3>

	<p>
		Sending a direct test submission is very simple. Honest.
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Cut and paste the HTML in the textarea and replace your own &lt;form&gt; tag with it.
			The HTML will look something like this:

			{% codemirror html %}
<form action="http://www.yoursite.com/path/to/form_tools/process.php" method="post">
	<input type="hidden" name="form_tools_initialize_form" value="1" />
	<input type="hidden" name="form_tools_form_id" value="X" />
            {% endcodemirror %}

			If you indicated that this form contained a file upload field, you will see an extra
			enctype="multipart/form-data" attribute. Note: if your existing form tag has other
			attributes like name or onsubmit, feel free to add them to the generated code. The
			important thing is that the method is set to POST and the action path is correct. The
			<b>form_tools_initialize_form</b> hidden field tells Form Tools that the form data being
			submitted is to be used for the test submission. The <b>form_tools_form_id</b>
			hidden field is a unique number generated by the program to differentiate between the
			various forms.
		</li>
		<li>
			Now, return to your form in your browser and after refreshing the page, fill in all
			fields and submit the form. Return to Form Tools and click the Refresh button in the
			page, then continue to the next step.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Test Submission: API</h3>

	{% include screenshot.html item='i215.jpg' %}

	<p>
		Configuring your form to use the API to submit your test submission is covered in the following
		tutorials:
