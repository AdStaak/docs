		The Views tab is the main hub for adding and managing your form Views. By default,
		all new forms are given a single View containing all form fields, labeled "All Submissions".
		Of course, this can be modified or removed, but you should always have at least one View
		defined - otherwise a huge amount of the Form Tools functionality (like viewing the
		submissions!) won't be possible.
	</p>

		<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/views">Views section</a>.
