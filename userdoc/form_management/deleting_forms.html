		If you no longer need a form, you can completely remove it from Form Tools by going to the
		Manage Forms page and clicking its DELETE link. Please be very careful! Deleting a form
		cannot be undone - all data will be deleted.
	</p>

	<p>
		As of version 1.3.0 you will be redirected to a separate page to explicitly delete a form.
		This will let you know which files (if any) that had been uploaded through that form's
		fields and are slated for deletion.
