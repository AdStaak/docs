	<p>
		The next important thing to know is that Form Tools is arranged into separate, distinct pieces called
		<i>components</i>. Here's what they are.
	</p>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-3">
			<strong>Form Tools Core</strong>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-9">
			The Core contains all code required for the most basic usage of the script. It
			includes the default theme, which ensures that the HTML for rendering the pages is
			always up to date, and the default English translation file. You can
			see what's changed in the Core code by looking at the
			<a href="http://docs.formtools.org/changelog.php">Core changelog</a>.
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-3">
			<strong>Modules</strong>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-9">
			Modules are separate components which perform individual tasks. They are installed
			and uninstalled by the Form Tools administrator. Like the other API and themes,
			they are totally separate from the Core. You can see a list of all modules
			here: <a href="http://modules.formtools.org">modules.formtools.org</a>.
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-3">
			<strong>Themes</strong>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-9">
			<a href="http://themes.formtools.org">Themes</a> let you customize the appearance of
			the interface for any Form Tools user. There are a few to choose from, and you can
			always create your own.
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-3">
			<strong>API</strong>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-9">
			The <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/api">API</a> (<i>Application Programming
			Interface</i>) is a set of functions written for programmers who'd like to use
			Form Tools functionality and data within their own code / websites.
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-3">
			<strong>Translation Files</strong>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-9">
			Every language string within Form Tools is loaded from a language file. The
			translation files can be downloaded from
			<a href="http://translations.formtools.org">translations.formtools.org</a>.
		</div>
	</div>
