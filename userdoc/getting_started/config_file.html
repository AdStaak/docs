	<h4>The config.php file</h4>

	<p>
		The config.php file, found in your /global folder contains special settings for
		to your own Form Tools installation: database connection values, the root folder and URLs
		and other information. This file is unique to your installation and <b>it's the only
		file in the script that you need to edit</b>.
	</p>

	<p>
		The config.php file content is generated by the installation script. It's NOT in the
		downloadable zipfile.
	</p>

	<p>
		Whenever you do an upgrade, this file is never overwritten. Any custom settings
		should be stored in this file. Again: the downloadable zipfile containing the updated
		Form Tools contents will never contain a config.php, so upgrading is as simple as
		uploading the new files to your web server and logging back in.
		[<a href="/upgrading/">Click here</a> for a more complete discussion of
		upgrading].
	</p>

	<p>
		If you've been sniffing around, you may have noticed that the library.php also
		contains variables defining these values - but <i>DO NOT EDIT THEM THERE!</i> The
		library.php file contains the <b>default</b> values for all application-wide settings;
		the config.php just overrides the ones that are necessary. This keeps everything nice
		and tidy and simplifies upgrading.
	</p>


	<h4>Required Settings</h4>


	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-3">
			<strong>$g_root_url</strong>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-9">
			This is the base URL of the Form Tools installation on your server. e.g.
			<b>http://www.yoursite.com/formtools</b>. You can either supply an absolute or
			relative URL. Note: if you include the full URL, make sure that the "www." part
			is either included or removed consistently; if you try to log in at
			<b>http://www.yoursite.com/admin</b> but your $root_url is set to
			<b>http://yoursite.com/admin</b> it will not work! (and vice versa).
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-3">
			<strong>$g_root_dir</strong>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-9">

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-3">
			<strong>$g_db_name</strong>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-9">
			The name of the database. Most often, hosting providers provide you with some sort of
			user interface for creating databases and assigning user accounts to them. If you are
			creating a new database for Form Tools, I would recommend "form_tools" for clarity.
			Enter the database name here.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-3">
			<strong>$g_db_username</strong>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-9">
			The MySQL username. Note: this user account must have privileges for creating new
			tables, in addition to adding and removing records.

			<strong>$g_db_password</strong>

			database server.

	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-4">
			<strong>$g_table_prefix</strong>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-8">
			This value lets you define a custom database prefix for your Form Tools tables. This is
			handy if Form Tools will be added to an existing database and you want to avoid table
			naming conflicts. By default it it set to <b>ft_</b>. If you do not need to use a
			different value, you needn't define it in your config.php file: it is already defaulted
			to ft_ in your library.php file.
		</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-4">
			<strong>$g_max_nav_pages</strong>

		<div class="col-lg-8">
			This setting should be enabled prior to including this file in any external script
			that doesn't require the person to be logged into Form Tools. The API, for example,
			automatically sets this to false. This lets you leverage the Form Tools functionality
			in the outside world without already being logged into Form Tools.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-4">
			<strong>$g_default_error_reporting</strong>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-8">
			For release candidates and main releases, this is set to 1 by default, meaning
			that only genuine PHP errors are displayed. For Beta releases, this is set to
			2047 - all errors and warning are displayed, which can help with debugging.

			<strong>$g_debug</strong>
		</div>

		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-8">
			This tells Smarty to create the compiled templates in subdirectories, which is
			slightly more efficient. It's not compatible on some systems, so it's set to false
			by default.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-4">
			<strong>$g_query_str_multi_val_separator</strong>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-8">
			This determines the value used to separate the content of array form submissions (e.g. checkboxes
			in your form that have the same name, or multi-select dropdowns) when submitted via a query string
			for "direct" form submissions (added in version 1.4.2).
		</div>

		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-7">
			For module developers. This prevents the code from automatically deleting your

		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-8">
			This setting lets you control the type of sessions the application uses. The default
			value is "php", but you can change it to "database" if you'd rather use database sessions.
			This affects all Form Tools accounts and determines the session type for forms that are
			integrated with the API.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-4">
			<strong>$g_session_save_path</strong>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-8">
			This setting was added in <b>2.0.0-beta-20090614</b>. It lets you define the location
			where temporary PHP sessions files should be created. Generally you won't need to define
			this value, but some hosting providers (e.g. iPowerWeb) require that you do so in order
			to use sessions.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-4">
			<strong>$g_api_debug</strong>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-8">
