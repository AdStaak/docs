	<p>
		Disabling a client account prevents that client from being able to log in to view and
		manage their form submissions. When clients try to log in with a disabled account, they
		will receive a message on the login screen informing them that their account has been
		disabled. <b>Note: disabling an account does not prevent any form submissions being
		stored for any of the user's forms</b>. To prevent this, you must
		<a href="/userdoc/form_management/disabling_forms">disable the form itself</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		To disable an account, click on the <b>Clients</b> link in the leftmost navigation
		column, and click the appropriate EDIT link. On the <b>main</b> tab, change the value
		of the Status setting to "pending".
