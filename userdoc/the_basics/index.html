	<p>
		Form Tools is a <i>forms framework</i> written in PHP and MySQL. At its heart, it's
		a web form <b>processor, storage and data access script, designed to work with any existing
		web form</b>. The way it works is by creating custom database tables to store the unique
		data and structure of your form. It then provides assorted functionality for your data
		set: such as allowing you to view, update, cross-reference and export your submission
		data, mass data export via excel, printer-friendly rendering of your submission
		data, sorting and categorization, form submission editing and optional email of form
		submissions.
	</p>
	<p>
		To our knowledge, there's no other script out there that was designed in the same way - or
		any that provide anywhere near the degree of control that Form Tools affords you.
	</p>

	<p>
		Here are some of the script's key features:

	<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%" class="info">
		<tbody><tr>
			<td width="120" class="bold" valign="top">Free!</td>
			<td>
				Yup! Form Tools is available under the <a href="http://docs.formtools.org/license.php">GNU Public License</a>,
				free for anyone to download and modify. With 2.1.0, we're in the process of introducing
				a number of premium modules - but all the core functionality and script is still free.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="bold" valign="top">Re-usable</td>
			<td>
				A single installation can handle as many forms as you wish - even from different
				websites. You can set up as many client accounts as you wish, enabling multiple
				users to log in, view and manage their own data online. Form Tools 2 provides a
				wide palette of permission settings to allow you to precisely customize who sees
				what.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="bold" valign="top">Generic</td>
			<td>
				Very little modification to the web forms is needed to allow Form Tools to store
				their content. It works with virtually any web form!
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="bold" valign="top">Styles / UI</td>
			<td>
				The entire script is theme-based, using Smarty templates to generate the HTML.
				If need be, you can customize the UI for each of your clients so that it looks
				completely different for each user.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="bold" valign="top">Brandable</td>
			<td>
				By simply designing a default image and changing a few default values in the
				Setup Options, you may customize Form Tools as belonging to your own company.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="bold" valign="top">Extensible</td>
			<td>
				Form Tools 2 is fully modular, and some additional
				<a href="http://docs.formtools.org/module_development/">documentation</a> has been
				written to help you extend the script in whatever way you need. In addition, one of
				our main goals was to allow strong integration between our script and the outside
				world. For example, it was designed to be used in conjunction with other software,
				such as online credit card payment processing; the script is also designed to allow
				data export in a variety of (customizable) formats, such as XML. And, of course,
				since the code is downloadable for free under the <a href="http://docs.formtools.org/license.php">GNU
				Public License</a>, you can always access and edit the code yourself!
