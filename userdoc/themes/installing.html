	<p>
		Installing a new theme is very simple.
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>First, <a href="https://themes.formtools.org">browse the available themes</a> list on the
			Form Tools site to locate the theme you want.</li>
		<li>Next, download the theme to your desktop.
			<ul>
				<li>For zipfiles, unzip the file on your computer using whatever
					compressor/decompressor you have installed (Winzip, 7-zip). All themes are
					located in their own unique folder. Send the single folder to your webserver via FTP;
					it should be placed in your <b>[form tools root]/themes</b> folder.</li>
				<li>For tar.gz files, FTP the folder to your <b>[form tools root]/themes</b>
					folder on your webserver. SSH or telnet into your server and go to the themes folder.
					There, run this command (replace name_of_tar_file_here with the name of your tar
					file):

					<blockquote><pre>tar -xzvf name_of_tar_file_here.tar.gz</pre></blockquote>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Next, log into Form Tools and go to the Settings Â» Themes page. Here, click the
			"REFRESH THEME LIST" button. And that's it! You should now see your new theme.</li>
	</ol>
