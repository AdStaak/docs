	<p>
		Any time a form is created, a default View is created. This View
		contains all form fields, it's set to 10 submissions per page (or whatever value
		you've entered in the Settings -&gt; Main page), it orders the listings by
		submission date - most recent first, and is publicly accessible by all clients.
	</p>

		{% include screenshot.html item="i256.gif" %}
		Creating a new View is very simple. Just go to your Edit Form Â» Views tab and
		click the "Create View" link for whatever View group you want to add it to. This link
		it found at the <i>bottom right</i> of all View group sections. If you've
		deleted all the View Groups, you'll see the option to create a new, default View. Click it!
	</p>

	<p>
		Normally, when adding a new View, you'll see a dialog window appear that looks something
		like the screenshot to your right. This is extremely powerful: it lets you
		create a new View with all the fields, no fields, or base it on an existing View. If you
		find yourself needing to create multiple, similar Views, this can be a very important
		time-saver.
