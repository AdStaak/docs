<h3>Main Tab</h3>

{% include screenshot.html item='i258.png' %}

<p>
    The main tab contains the main, general settings for your View. Here's where you go
    to specify permissions and other such important info. As of 2.1.x, you can also
    come here to specify default values for your form submissions added within the Form
    Tools interface. This is a particularly nice addition - read below for more information.
</p>

<div class="clear"></div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-3"><code>View Name</code></div>
    <div class="col-lg-9">
        This value is used to identify the View. It appears in both the administrator's and
        the client's UI. Generally you'll want to enter something human-friendly that
        clearly describes what information the View is encapsulating.
    </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Submissions per page</code></div>
    <div class="col-lg-9">
        This determines the number of submissions that should appear in the main submission
        listing page. It affects all people accessing the View via the Form Tools UI.
    </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Default Sort Order</code></div>
    <div class="col-lg-9">
        This value defaults to Submission Date descending (i.e. most recent first) for all
        new Views, but you can change it to whatever you need. Sometimes it can be beneficial
        to sort alphabetically, for example. Two tips:
        <ul>
            <li>Bear in mind that you DO have the option to allow any column to be sortable -
                this may be set on the Fields tab.
            </li>
            <li>Even though this field lets you select any form field to acts as the default
                sort order, you should probably choose a field that you specify in the
                <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/views/columns_tab/">Edit View &raquo; Columns tab</a>. That way, if
                the user changes the
                sort order on the Submission Listing page, they can always click the original column
                to achieve the old sort order. If you chose a field for the default sort order that
                isn't a column, it could be a bit weird for the user!
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Access</code></div>
    <div class="col-lg-9">
        This option lets you determine who can see the View. For more information on this
        setting, see <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/views/permissions/">View Permissions</a> page.
    </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Can add submissions</code></div>
    <div class="col-lg-9">
        This option hides / shows the "Add Â»" button on the main submission listing page and
        on the individual Edit Submission pages. This affects both client and administrator
        accounts. Tip: to control the label of this button, go to the Edit Form &raquo; main tab.
    </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Default Values for New Submissions</code></div>
    <div class="col-lg-9">
        This section appears when "Can add submissions" is set to "yes". It lets you to specify default values for
        submission fields when added through the Form Tools interface. All you need to do is add those fields that you
        would like to contain default values, and specify exactly what values you want them to have.

        This section is very important if your View has <a href="">filters</a>. Filters limit what submissions appear
        in the View. So unless your submission contains values that match the criteria you entered immediately after
        the submission is created, it may appear that creating a submission does nothing - since you can never view the
        submission in your View.

        <p>
            Since version 3.0.13 of the Core, you can also enter the following placeholders. These work for any Form
            Tools user account (admin or client) and will have their values replaced with their content.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>{% raw %}{$ACCOUNT_ID}{% endraw %}</b></li>
            <li><b>{% raw %}{$USERNAME}{% endraw %}</b></li>
            <li><b>{% raw %}{$EMAIL}{% endraw %}</b></li>
            <li><b>{% raw %}{$FIRST_NAME}{% endraw %}</b></li>
            <li><b>{% raw %}{$LAST_NAME}{% endraw %}</b></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            You may also use placeholders from the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/extended_client_fields/">Extended
            Client Fields</a> module here to add values from those fields. That module (version 2.1.0 and later) lists
            the available placeholders.
        </p>

</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Can copy submissions</code></div>
    <div class="col-lg-9">
        This option hides / shows the Copy button on the submission listing page. It allows users to make copies
        selected submissions. By default this button is hidden.
    </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Can delete submissions</code></div>
    <div class="col-lg-9">
        This option hides / shows the Delete button on the main submission listing page and
        on the individual Edit Submission pages. This affects both client and administrator
        accounts.
