	<h4>Fields tab</h4>

	{% include screenshot.html item="i260.gif" %}

	<p>
		The fields tab lets you customize which of your form fields appear in the View, in what
		order, and other such fun stuff. This page was totally re-written in Form Tools 2.1
		because we found that a great deal of your time was spent configuring Views: especially
		the View fields. So now, it's considerably faster to configure your Views - it's all
		done client-side with drag and drop, dialog windows and <i>general awesomeness</i>.
	</p>

	<p><b>Field groups</b></p>

	<p>
		Take a quick look at the screenshot to the right. As you can see, all form field rows
		are contained with a group. The group may or may not be named. If you choose to name it,
		then a header will appear above that section on the Edit Submission page the clearly
		delineates those fields. This is a great addition to Form Tools, and can really help
		visually break up related fields on larger forms, making it simpler for Form Tools users
		to manage the submission data.
	</p>

	<p>
		Unlike 2.0.x where you had to manually assign each and every field to a tab, now you
		just assign a field group to a tab. Just select the tab in the top right of the View
		field group.
	</p>

	<p><b>Adding fields</b></p>

	<p>
		{% include screenshot.html item="i261.gif" %}
		To add more fields to your View, click on the "Add Views Â»" link at the bottom right
		of the View group. That will open up a dialog looking something like the screenshot
		to the left. The goal here was simplicity: we wanted a quick and easy way to pinpoint
		which fields you want to add. Just select those fields you want and click the
		"Add Fields" button at the bottom of the dialog window. The dialog will instantly
		close and insert the fields at the bottom of the group you selected.
	</p>

	<p><b>Re-sorting fields</b></p>

	<p>
		No problem: mouse-over the first "Order" column. Notice that the mouse icon changes to a
		draggable pointer? Just drag the row up or down to whatever location you want. To drag into
		another field group, just drag it over!
	</p>

	<p>
		Tip: if you have multiple rows you need to drag to a new location, you'll want to bind
		them together first, then drag them all at once. To do that, just click between the
		bars to the left of the Order column to join/break the rows. For more information on
		Sortables in Form Tools 2.1, <a href="?page=sortables">give this page a read over</a>. :)
	</p>

	<p><b>Re-sorting field groups...?</b></p>

	<p>
		Yup! You can do this too. See the little icon at the top left of the View groups? Like with
		the same icon on the field rows, that signifies that it's sortable. To re-sort it, just click
		on the group then drag up or down.
	</p>

	<p><b>The field tables</b></p>

	<p>
		Here's what the table columns mean:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Order</b>. As discussed. This determines the order in which the field appears in
			the View.</li>
		<li><b>Field</b>. This identifies the field.</li>
		<li><b>Field Type</b>. A little more information so you know what the field is.</li>
		<li><b>Editable</b>. This determines whether the field can be edited through this View.</li>
		<li><b>Searchable</b>. This lets you determine whether or not the user can search on this
			field on the main Submission Listing page. Note: if you uncheck this column for all fields,
			the search bar on the Submission Listing page simply isn't relevant and it will be hidden.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>

		<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/views/columns_tab">Edit View -&gt; Columns tab</a>!
