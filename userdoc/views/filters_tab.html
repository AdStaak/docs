	<h3>Filters tab</h3>

	<p>
		{% include screenshot.html item='i263.gif' %}
		The final configuration option for your Views is the option of being able to define
		<b>filters</b>. Filters lets you define custom rules for limiting the submissions that
		appear in your View. While the contents of the Edit View -&gt; Fields tab let you control
		which <b>fields</b> appear in the View, filters let you control which <b>submissions</b>
		appear. This functionality used to be found on the Edit Client Accounts pages
		but has been moved here with Form Tools 2.
	</p>

	<p>
		Form Tools comes with two types of filters:
		<i>Standard filters</i>, and <i>Client Map</i> filters. They provide you with two alternative
		ways to limit the submissions that appear in the View.
	</p>

	<p>
		You may define as many filters as you want for each View. When you add multiple filters,
		<b>all</b> conditions have to be met for a submission to appear in the View. For example,
		if you define a standard filter for "state" to be "WA" and another for "City" to be
		"Seattle", the View will only contain submissions that are for Seattle, Washington - and
		none other.
	</p>

	<p>
		The following two pages describe the filter types, followed by some examples of how they
		can be used.
