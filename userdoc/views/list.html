		The Edit Form -&gt; Views tab has changed a bit in 2.1.x. It now provides a lot more
		functionality than previous version. Click on the screenshot to the right to get an
		idea of what sort of things you can do with it.
	</p>

	<h4>View Groups</h4>

	<p>
		First up, you can now group the Views - every View must belong to a single group. At the
		time of writing (August 2011), the only immediate practical application of the grouping
		is that on the Edit Submission and Submission Listing pages (client and admin), when you
		click on the Views dropdown, you'll see the Views listed and grouped as you set them up
		on this page. However, the grouping mechanism is very likely to be utilized in other
		ways in the future (e.g. such as assigning a client to a group of View, rather than one by
		one).
	</p>

	<p>
		The group names are optional. So if you don't want the Views dropdown on the Submission
		Listing and Edit Submission pages to show a heading (technically an "optgroup") for the
		Views, just omit the group name.
	</p>

	<h4>The View tables</h4>

	<p>
		Each View group lists the Views one above the other. Each row contains a great deal
		of information about the View, so you can get a good overview just by learning what
		each column means. The first few columns: <b>View ID</b>, <b>View name</b> and <b>Who can
		access?</b> are pretty self-explanatory, but the remaining columns are not so
		self-evident. To find out what they mean, move your mouse over any cell - a tooltip will
		appear, describing what the data means.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Columns</b>: this shows how many of the form fields are being used as columns on
			the View's main Submission Listing page. (This is the page that lists all your submission
			data, when you're viewing and editing the information).</li>
		<li><b>Fields</b>: the number of fields that are visible in the View.</li>
		<li><b>Tabs</b>: the number of tabs defined in the View</li>
		<li><b>Filters</b>: the number of filters defined in the View</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Clicking on any cell will redirect you to the appropriate page. Even though there's a lot
		of information presented on the page, once you get your bearing you should find it very
		quick and simple to use (and don't forget the tooltips if you forget!)
	</p>

	<h4>Re-sorting View groups and Views</h4>

	<p>
		Form Tools 2.1.0 added in client-side sorting for all components. Give
		<a href="?page=sortables">this page</a> a read over. It explains all about sorting in
		Form Tools.
