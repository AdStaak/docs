	<p>
		If you've read the previous page, by now you should have a pretty good idea of what
		Standard filters do and how they work. Here's a few additional examples for situations that
		might crop up. All of the examples are based on the same fictional "Send us your resume"
		form for the federal government, where each submission is a person's resume.
	</p>

	<h4>Example 1: Only letting clients view "reviewed" submissions</h4>

	<p>
		You may find that you don't want clients to view all submissions that go through a form
		the moment they are sent. Perhaps you need to review them first for whatever reason -
		quality control, check them for relevance, etc.
	</p>

	<p>
		Since there's nothing in the database that distinguishes a "non-reviewed" from a
		"reviewed" submission, we're simply going to add it! Once it's been added, we'll create
		a new View filter on that field so that all clients who are associated with the View will
		only see submissions that meet that criteria: namely, those that have been reviewed by
		you, the administrator.
	</p>

	<p>
		First, click on the Database tab of the Edit Form pages. Here, click "Add Field(s)" and
		leave "1" as the default value. Add the following values:
	</p>

	<table cellspacing="0" width="100%">
		<tbody><tr>
			<td width="250" class="blue">Auto-generate database column names</td>
			<td>Leave <b>checked</b>.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue">Pass On</td>
			<td>Leave <b>unchecked</b>.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue" valign="top">Form Field Name</td>
			<td>
				This new field isn't going to be passed along in the form with the other fields, but
				Form Tools still requires a value here. It doesn't matter what you enter here, just
				so long as it isn't already used by a form field. I'd suggest something like
				"reviewed123" which will almost certainly be unique.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue">Display Text</td>
			<td>Enter "Reviewed".</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue">Field Size</td>
			<td>Leave as "Tiny (&lt; 5 chars)".</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue">Data Type</td>
			<td>Leave as "String".</td>
		</tr>
		</tbody></table>

	<p>
		After clicking "ADD FIELDS", this new field will be stored in the database for your form
		submissions.
	</p>

	<p>
		Next, we want to make it a radio button option with two options: "No" and "Yes". Click
		on the Fields tab, change the Field Type for the new Reviewed field to "Radio
		buttons". Now click "UPDATE"; after the page reloads, click on the "Options" link.
		That page will list all of the relevant settings for this form field. On the "Field
		Option Group" click the "Create New Group" button <b>or</b> select an existing group, if
		a group already exists with the options "Yes" and "No" (only).
	</p>

	<p>
		We're getting there! On this new page, labeled "New Group" add two rows to the form, and
		enter "Yes" and "No" for both the Field Value and Display Text columns. Check "horizontal"
		for the Field Orientation setting and click the Update button.
	</p>

	<p>
		Now let's take a breath. What have we done up to this point? We've created a new field
		that can be used in your form Views, that will be displayed as "Yes" and "No" radio
		buttons. The next, and final step is to associate it with one or more Views!
	</p>

	<p>
		On your Edit Form » Views page, create a new View - base it on whatever existing
		View you want it to be most like. On the Fields tab, add the new Reviewed field - and set
		&nbsp;it as a column. This makes it appear in the main submission listing page.
	</p>

	<p>
		Now click on the "[View Submissions]" link at the top right and select the View you just
		created. Assuming your form has at least one submission, you'll now see a new, blank
		column for "Reviewed". [Tip: to set the default value to "No" for all future submissions,
		add a hidden field to your form called "reviewed123" with a value of "No"]. For any
		submission, click on the "VIEW" link and change the "Reviewed" value to "Yes". Now you've
		officially reviewed one of your submissions!
	</p>

	<p>
		Finally - and most importantly! - we're going to add our filter for the View. This will
		prevent EVERYONE assigned to the View from viewing any non-reviewed submissions. Edit the
		View and go to the Filters tab. Select the "Reviewed" field. Change the operator value
		to "Equals" and enter the text "Yes" in the Value(s) column. Click the "UPDATE" button
		and you're done! To confirm that it's working properly, view the form submissions and select
		the appropriate View. You should now only see a single submission appear - the one you
		marked off as "Reviewed".
	</p>

	<p>
		The above example covers a lot of ground. Once you become more familiar with Views and
		Export Field Groups, it won't seem half so daunting!
	</p>


	<br>
	<h4>Example 2: "Disabling" an account by hiding all new submissions</h4>

	<p class="notify">
		On a related note, you may also wish to see the Hooks Manager module documentation for an
		example of how to do something similar: <u><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/hooks_manager/example/client_account_expiry_dates">adding a
		"expiry date" to a client account</a></u>.
	</p>


	<p>
		If you're using Form Tools as a paid service for clients, you may need to disable
		a user's account until payment is received. One solution is to simply set "Active"
		to "no" (Permission tab): this will prevent the client from logging in. However, you
		may also wish to continue to let them log in, but not show any <b>new</b> submissions.
		This may be a more elegant solution, letting them see things still work, but they
		cannot see anything new without getting their account up to date. You could also add a
		"Payment required!" page via the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/pages/">Pages Module</a> which
		they'd see after logging in - to make it completely clear that they cannot see any new
		submissions.
	</p>
	<p>
		To do this, go to this Edit Form » Views tab, and add a new View called something
		like "No New Submissions" - base it on whatever View the client already sees. Next, edit
		the View and click on the Filters tab. In the "Field" column, select the "Submission
		Date" field (or whatever you named it). Set the operator to "Before" and click on the
		calendar icon. Here, select a date. After you click "UPDATE", anyone associated with the
		View will now only be able to view submissions up to that date. Finally, unassign that
		client from the OTHER View - the View that doesn't limit the submissions.
	</p>

	<h4>Example 3: Showing only submissions within a date range</h4>

	<p>
		This may be useful to give a client a sample of submissions for illustration purposes.
		It is very similar to Example 2.
	</p>
	<p>
		Repeat everything in the last example, except this time, include TWO filters: one for
		"Before" a certain date and one for "After". This will limit everyone associated with
		the View to only have access to those submissions in the date range supplied.
	</p>
