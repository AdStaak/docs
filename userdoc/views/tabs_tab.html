	<h3>Tabs... err, tab</h3>

	<p>
		"Tabs tab"? Boy, who <i>wrote</i> this documentation? Sheesh.
	</p>

	<p>
		A nice new addition to Form Tools 2 is the option to display your form submissions
		in custom-defined tabs. This can significantly simplify the user interface for yourself
		and your users, letting you organize your data into re. Generally this feature is
		most useful for larger forms with a lot of data.
	</p>

	<p>
		{% include screenshot.html item='i262.gif' %}
		By default, all new (blank) Views are created with a single tab: "Data". This, however, is
		easily customizable. Just edit your View and click on the "Tabs" tab. Here, enter whatever
		tab labels you want. You can enter up to six.
	</p>

	<p>
		Tip: you may have noticed the "Update" button on the Edit View page is <i>outside</i> of
		the four tabs (Main, Fields, Tabs and Filters). Whenever you see this, it means that when
		you click it, it updates the data for all tabs. If the button is INSIDE one of the tabs,
		it updates that tab alone. So here, you can edit all of the View information then update
		it with a single click. Don't feel like you have to update the tabset information before
		going to the Fields tab to assign your fields to your tabs: the dropdowns on the fields
		tab are updated automatically.
	</p>

	<p>
		Next, click on the Fields tab and click on a dropdown at the top of a View group:
		that will list whatever tabs you have entered. Select the appropriate
		ones you need and click update. You're done! Try editing a submission with this particular
		View and see how it looks.
	</p>
