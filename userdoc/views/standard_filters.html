	<p>
		{% include screenshot.html item='i264.gif' %}
		A standard filter is where you limit the submissions that appear in the View by
		comparing the actual value in a form field to a value or values, specified
		in the filter. For example, click
		on the screenshot to the right: it shows a single standard filter that limits the
		results to submissions that have the value "Delegate" for the Attendee Type field.
		In other words, the View only shows Delegate and no other Attendee Types
	</p>

	<p>
		You can assign that view to a client account so that when they log
		in they only see submissions from Vancouver.
	</p>

	<p>
		Since standard filters are entirely customizable, you can construct them for whatever
		is relevant for your form.
	</p>

	<p>
		Creating a filter is pretty self-explanatory, but here's a few comments about some
		of the less obvious things.
	</p>

	<h4>Operators</h4>

	<p>
		The second column on the View filters page lets you choose your "operator". An operator
		is just a logical rule like "==" (equals) or "!=" (not equals). There are two sets of
		operators which appear, depending on the form field you selected.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Date fields</b>: If you have selected a field with the "Date" field type, the
			operator dropdown will contain two options: "before" and "after". Click on the
			calendar icon to see a javascript calendar, to help you select and input your
			date in the right format.</li>
		<li>Other fields: for all other fields, you will see three options: "Equals", "Not
			Equals" and "Like".

			<ul>
				<li><b>Equals</b>: The submission field must be exactly equal to the value or values
					defined in the values column for it to appear for the client (N.B. I don't
					believe this is case-sensitive).</li>
				<li><b>Not Equals</b>: The submission field must not be equal to the value or any
					of the values defined in the values column for it to appear for the client.</li>
				<li><b>Like</b>: The submission must be "like" the value entered, in other words
					it must be a string that contains the string found in the values column.
				</li>
				<li><b>Not Like</b>: as you'd expect, the opposite of "Like".</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		The two pairs "equals/not equals" and "like/not like" are similar, but different. For
		technical readers, the "like" operators correspond exactly to the SQL "LIKE" clause:
		they allows you to do <b>pattern matching</b> on the form submission content - not
		strict tests for equality.
	</p>

	<p>
		For example, consider these two rules:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Submission ID, Equals, 10: This will filter out everything except the single
			submission with the submission ID value of 10.</li>
		<li>Submission ID, Like, 10: This will show any submission whose submission ID contains 10, so :
			10, 100, 101, 102, 4010, etc.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Values</h4>
	<p>
		This is where you enter the string value or values that you want to filter on. Like
		with the "operator" column, the contents of this column will change depending on
		whether you selected the Submission Date or Last Modified field or not. For the
		submission date, you will see a textbox and a calendar icon. Clicking the icon will
		open a javascript calendar where you can choose a date and time.
	</p>

	<p>
		Remember that for dropdown fields, radio buttons and checkboxes, you need to define
		the field <b>value</b> not the <b>label</b> here. Form Tools always stores the
		values of the form fields, not whatever the label happens to be.
	</p>

	<h4>Multiple Values</h4>

	<p>
		To save you the bother of having to define multiple, similar filters for the same
		form field, you can use the pipe ("|") character to list multiple values for a
		single filter.
	</p>

	<p>
		For example, if you had a form containing a "department" dropdown and would like to
		filter out all submissions <b>other than</b> those headed to the Arts or Humanities
		departments, you could use the "Equals" operator, and enter "Arts|Humanities" in the
		values string. If you would like to show everything <b>except</b> Arts and
		Humanities, you could use the "Not Equals" operator, and use the same "values"
		string. Hopefully, this should work the way you would expect, but here's a breakdown
		of the logic for both cases:
	</p>


{% highlight html %}
IF: (("field A" EQUALS "Arts") OR ("field A" EQUALS "Humanities"))
THEN: show the submission.

IF: (("field A" DOES NOT EQUAL "Arts") AND ("field A" DOES NOT EQUAL "Humanities"))
THEN: show the submission.
{% endhighlight %}


<p>
