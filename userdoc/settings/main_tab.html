    <div class="clear"></div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Version</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            This lists your current Form Tools version. This version is for the Core script; the API,
            modules and themes all have their own versions. Next to the version information is a button
            linking to the Form Tools site. This send information about the components
            you have installed (Core, modules, themes and API) and their versions to the main
            upgrade script. That does the job of figuring out what (if anything) has been updated
            and generates a custom zip file containing those components. The upgrade process is
            anonymous: no information about your own website or account is submitted along with
            the request.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Program Name</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            This option was included to help simplify the job of re-branding the software. Changing
            the script name here changes all references throughout the script, however, you will
            probably wish to add or update and existing theme as well.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Logo Link URL</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            This has a single purpose: it determines the URL the individual is redirected to
            when they click on the main script logo.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Num <b>****</b> Per Page</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            The final settings determine the number of items that appear per page in each of the
            sections. Depending on your screen-size and data, you may find it helpful to increase
            or decrease the default values.
