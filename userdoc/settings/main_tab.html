		The first <b>main</b> tab of the Settings pages contains several of Form Tools general
		settings.

			<td width="160" class="blue" valign="top">Version</td>
			<td>
				This lists your current Form Tools version. This version is for the Core script; the API,
				modules and themes all have their own versions. Next to the version information is a button
				linking to the Form Tools site. This send information about the components
				you have installed (Core, modules, themes and API) and their versions to the main
				upgrade script. That does the job of figuring out what (if anything) has been updated
				and generates a custom zip file containing those components. The upgrade process is
				anonymous: no information about your own website or account is submitted along with
				the request.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue" valign="top">Program Name</td>
			<td>
				This option was included to help simplify the job of re-branding the software. Changing
				the script name here changes all references throughout the script, however, you will
				probably wish to add or update and existing theme as well.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue" valign="top">Logo Link URL</td>
			<td>
				This has a single purpose: it determines the URL the individual is redirected to
				when they click on the main script logo.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue" valign="top">Num <b>****</b> Per Page</td>
			<td>
				The final settings determine the number of items that appear per page in each of the
				sections. Depending on your screen-size and data, you may find it helpful to increase
				or decrease the default values.
