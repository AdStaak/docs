		Form Tools 2 comes with a great number of new features over its precessor. To help keep
		all the new settings categorized and organized, the settings section is split into
		five tabs. The following pages explain the contents of each tab, one by one.

	<h3>Whither the WYSIWYG tab?</h3>

	<p>
		For users who are familiar with 2.0.x versions of the script, you'll notice the WYSIWYG
		tab has disappeared. Egads! But don't worry: the default settings for the WYSIWYG field
		are still around, just now found in the
		<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/field_type_tinymce/">TinyMCE field type module</a>.
		At the time of writing this, all the same functionality is still available - and now it'll
		be easier to expand on it.
