		The <b>files</b> tab contains those settings related to file uploads for Form Tools and any
		forms configured with Form Tools. This page contains settings such as the max file size,
		file types and the file upload folder. All of these settings can be overridden for each
		individual file field, but it's far more convenient to set the general settings here
		first.

			<td class="blue" valign="top">Max File Size</td>
			<td>
				This determines the maximum size of files that can be uploaded through the UI and
				through your forms. The filesize options available in the download relate to your

				uploaded as determined by your php.ini file.
