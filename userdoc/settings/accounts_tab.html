		The <b>accounts</b> tab controls the default settings for all new client accounts. Entering
		the appropriate values in this page can help you reduce the amount of configuration work
		for you. These settings merely act as the DEFAULT settings: you will still be able to override each
		setting for each client.
	</p>

	<p>
		The screenshot to the right shows the Accounts page in version <b>2.0.3</b> of the Core. In
		earlier versions, you won't see the Security Settings section.
	</p>

	<p>
		N.B. There was a minor change in 2.0.3 in that passwords are no longer limited to
		alphanumeric characters, as with 2.0.2 and earlier.

		<tbody><tr>
			<td width="160" class="blue" valign="top">Page Titles</td>
			<td>
				This setting determines the string that will appear in the web browser for the web page,
				via the &lt;title&gt; HTML node. You can enter whatever string you want, but bear in mind
				it will appear for all pages. It's a good idea to include the <b>{$page}</b> Smarty
				placeholder in this field, too. That placeholder is replaced with the actual page name
				for each page within the Form Tools UI.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue" valign="top">Footer Text</td>
			<td>
				By default, this value is blank. But if you include a value, it will appear at the
				bottom of each page. A common use for this is to add a copyright line.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue" valign="top">Default Theme</td>
			<td>
				The default theme for all new accounts.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue" valign="top">Login Page</td>
			<td>
				This determines what page the client will get directed to after logging in. By default,
				this is set to the Forms page, but you pick whatever you want. This field is compatible
				with the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/pages/">Pages module</a> - so you can create
				custom pages and make them the client's login page.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue" valign="top">Logout URL</td>
			<td>
				The URL where the clients are redirected to when they click Logout.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue" valign="top">Default Language</td>
			<td>
				The default language for the client accounts.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue" valign="top">System Time Offset</td>
			<td>
				This setting lets you accomodate for differences between your server timezone and your
				own timezone. This ensures times are all displayed in the correct time for your clients.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue" valign="top">Default Sessions Timeout</td>
			<td>
				This determines the default inactivity timeout for the client accounts.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue" valign="top">Date Format</td>
			<td>
				This setting lets you control the formatting of all dates within Form Tools. For
				non-English installations, you'll probably want to change this value to exclude any
				English strings. The formatting codes are from the php
				<a href="http://ca.php.net/manual/en/function.date.php">date()</a> function.

	<h3>Security Settings</h3>

	<p>
		As mentioned above, this section was added in 2.0.3. It provides a few additional security
		settings for the security-conscious. All these settings are turned off for new installations
		and upgrades.
	</p>

	<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1" width="100%">
		<tbody><tr>
			<td width="160" class="blue" valign="top">
				Auto-disable account after # failed login attempts
			</td>
			<td>
				This setting prevents brute-force attempts at hacking a user account. The script
				automatically disables the user account after a unbroken series of failed login
				attempts.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue" valign="top">Minimum password length</td>
			<td>
				This lets you force client passwords to be of a minimum number of characters.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue" valign="top">Required password characters</td>
			<td>
				This settings is pretty self-explanatory: it lets you force the client account passwords
				to contain certain characters - uppercase, numbers and "special" chars. This can
				significantly reduce the likelihood of hackers guessing the account passwords.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue" valign="top">Prevent re-use of # last passwords</td>
			<td>
				Form Tools automatically logs passwords and password changes for client accounts. This
				setting lets you tap into that and prevent the client from re-using an old password.
				Preventing password re-use like this can again reduce the likelihood of successful
				hacking attempts.
			</td>
		</tr>
