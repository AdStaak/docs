	<h3>Passwords</h3>

	<p>
		The password field is very basic, so I won't waste a screenshot on it. The only optional
		setting in the Field Comments setting, to allow you to add some comments underneath it.
	</p>

	<p>
		One thing that should be mentioned, however, is that unlike actual Form Tools user accounts passwords,
        <i>password fields in your forms are not encrypted in the database</i>. They are stored plain text and when
        viewing the data, you will see the password appear as it was originally typed in.

	</p>
