	<p>
		Form Tools 2.0.x included two other "special" field types in addition to the ones
		discussed already: a WYSIWYG editor field, which let you edit your fields in a simple
		rich-text editor, and a file upload field. With Form Tools' new field types structure,
		it no longer made sense to include them as part of the Core. Instead, they are now
		implemented as separate modules. There are many benefits to this, but the two most
		important ones are:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>this now allows us to update these modules independently of the Core, and</li>
		<li>it allows us to write additional modules to handle file uploading and rich-text
			editing with different modules / scripts.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
