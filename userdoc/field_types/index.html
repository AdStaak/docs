	<p>
		Form Tools 2.1.0 radically changed the way form field types were handled. Before 2.1, there was the following
        hardcoded list of supported field types:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Textbox</li>
		<li>Textarea</li>
		<li>Password</li>
		<li>WYWISYG (<a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/">TinyMCE</a>)</li>
		<li>File</li>
		<li>Radio Buttons</li>
		<li>Checkboxes</li>
		<li>Dropdown</li>
		<li>Multi-select dropdown</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		While these fields covered most typical uses, occasionally you'd run into a situation where you'd need
        something different. So, Form Tools 2.1.0 was designed to allow you to extend it to support any type of field
        you want - for example, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/field_type_google_maps/">Google Maps fields</a>,
        <a href="ft_phones/">Phone number fields</a>, or any of the HTML5 field
		types currently gaining traction with the browser vendors.
	</p>

	<p>
		The following section documents the ins and outs of the field types that are bundled
		with Form Tools 2.1, including the File and TinyMCE field type modules.
	</p>

	<p>
		Actual customization of the field types is done with the aid of the
		<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/custom_fields/">Custom Fields module</a>.
