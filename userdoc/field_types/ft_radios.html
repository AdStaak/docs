	<h3>Radio Buttons</h3>

	{% include screenshot.html item="i197.jpg" %}

	<p>
		Radio button fields in 2.1.0 work essentially the same as with earlier versions. As with
		checkboxes and dropdown fields, radio buttons first and foremost need a <i>data source</i>:
		i.e. the options that will appear in the radio button list. Like before, those options
		are defined in Option Lists (formerly called "Field Option Groups").
	</p>

	<p>
		So, when you change a field type on the Edit Form -&gt; Fields tab from (say) a textbox to a
		radio button group, you also need to edit the field in the Edit Field dialog window and
		assign the data source. But I get ahead of myself! Let's look at the available settings first -
		that'll help make sense of the field type.
	</p>

	<p>
		In the Edit Field dialog, there are three available options:
	</p>

	{% include screenshot.html item="i196.jpg" %}

	<ul>
		<li><b>Option List / Contents</b>: this field is required. It specifies the data source for
			the radio buttons. You have two choices: either use an Option List, or use the values pulled
			from a field from another form. This latter option is quite exciting: it effectively lets
			you tie together two distinct forms. Any time a new submission is added to the second form,
			the value in the field you specify will be included in the list of radio buttons displayed
			by this field.</li>
		<li><b>Formatting</b>: this is best illustrated in the screenshot at the top of the page.
			It gives you a little control over how the radio buttons are displayed. The options are:
			horizontally (one next to the other), vertically (one above the other), or in 2, 3 or 4
			columns. These latter options really help present the radios in a clear format.</li>
		<li><b>Field Comments</b>: as with the other field types, this setting lets you add a comment
			to appear underneath the field.</li>
	</ul>
