	<h4>Textareas</h4>

	<p>
		{% include screenshot.html item="i195.jpg" %}
		Textareas got a whole lot more customizable in 2.1. In earlier versions you had absolutely
		no control over how it would look or function. As my sister would say: <i>"Like, OMG, so
		totally boring"</i>. Amen, sis. See the screenshot to the right to see a few examples
		of what you can now do with textareas.
	</p>

	<p>
		You can now control the height, add colours for emphasis, comments and text- and
		word-counters. These are nice additions.
	</p>

		Here's a explanation of each field type in the Edit Field dialog window, and what each mean.
		See the screenshot to see how the available fields look.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Height</b>: this lets you control the visual height of the textbox field. For
			convenience, there are four preset heights you can choose from: tiny, small, medum and large.</li>
		<li><b>Field Comments</b>: this setting lets you add some comments to the field. Sometimes
			it can help to provide a little explanation to what information a field is storing - the
			field label (Display Text) may not be enough. Comments appear underneath the field.</li>
		<li><b>Highlight Colour</b>: this displays the textbox in a particular colour: red, orange,
			yellow, green or blue. Sometimes it can help to draw emphasis to particular important fields.</li>
		<li><b>Input length</b>: this setting is used in conjunction with the next. It lets you
			add a textcounter / wordcounter to the field to limit the amount of information entered.</li>
		<li><b>- Max length (words/chars)</b>: the number of words or characters.</li>
	</ul>
