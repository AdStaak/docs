	<p>
		The test tab lets you send and display emails generated with the settings you've entered
		on the first three tabs. Note: in order to use the test option, there must have been at
		least <b>one</b> submission in the database. The test functionality simulates a
		"real-life" case by using the data in one of your submissions.
	</p>

	<p>
		To test your email template, enter the email format to test (HTML, text
		or both), your email address and a submission ID (either by ID or by clicking the
		"random" option).
	</p>

	<p>
		You can test your email template in two ways:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>The <b>Display Email</b> button displays the email content in the page. This can be
			a little more convenient than actually sending the email, since you don't have to go
			fishing around in other programs looking for your email. That said, nothing beats sending
			the actual email to see how it looks. The various headers (from, reply-to, cc and bcc)) are
			only displayed in the page.</li>
		<li>The <b>Send Test Email</b> does just that: it sends the email to the email address
			specified.</li>
	</ol>

	<h4>A few remarks about sending test emails</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>Web servers send emails in different ways. Some of them send them immediately, others
			cache them and send them in a batch at various intervals over the course of a day (I
			encountered one once that only sent out emails once a day!). If you don't receive your
			email immediately, you may want to wait for a few hours to see if it arrives.</li>
		<li>If you don't receive your email within the expected time, check your spam folder.</li>
		<li>If you have installed and configured the Swift Mailer module, emails sent with
			this test facility will be sent via SMTP instead of with the default mail() script.</li>
		<li>As mentioned in other places in the documentation, the PHP mail() function used by
			the default Form Tools installation is notoriously fickle. It's implemented differently
			for each web server, and some servers limit options like being able to send email in
			multi-part format (HTML + text at the same time). If you have trouble getting it running,
			you may be interested in the <a href="http://modules.formtools.org/swift_mailer/?page=index">Swift Mailer
				module</a>.
		</li>
	</ul>
