	<p>
		The recipient(s) tab lets you control the email "headers", namely: the recipient list,
		the subject line and the reply-to and from email addresses.
	</p>


    <div class="clear"></div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Recipient(s)</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            This field lets you define who should receive this email. The dropdown contains four
            sections: <b>administrator</b>, <b>clients</b>, <b>user</b> and <b>other</b>. The admin
            and clients group contain recipients that are dynamically pulled from the database. The
            benefit to picking them here is that (a) it saves you some typing and makes it less
            likely you type in an email address incorrectly, and (b) any time the account
            information changes, the emails will automatically be updated too. The "user" option
            specifies the user who submitted the form. This will only appear if your form contains
            an email address for the sender, and you have <a href="../configure_form_email_fields/">configured
            it with Form Tools</a>.<br />
            <br />
            Make sure you click the "ADD" button to add the desired recipient.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Subject Line</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            This is the subject line of the email. You can enter placeholders (strings of text
            that are converted to other values) in this field to precisely customize the subject
            line. For a list of available placeholders, see the Reference tab.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>From</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            This lets you determine who the email is coming from. It's generally a good idea
            to include <b>someone's</b> email address here, because emails sent without a "from"
            sometimes incorrectly get identified as spam and never make it to the recipient's
            inbox.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Reply-to</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            This lets you determine the reply-to header of the email; i.e. where the email will
            go to if they click "reply" in their email client.
        </div>
    </div>

		If you have the Swift Mailer module installed and configured, you will also see an "undeliverable email
        recipient" field here. Please see the following page in the
		<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/swift_mailer/undeliverable_emails/">Swift Mailer documentation</a> for more
        information.
