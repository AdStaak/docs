	<p>
		As mentioned earlier, the out-the-box mail functionality is just the PHP mail() function.
		The benefit to using this function is that many servers have it pre-configured to
		allow you to send emails very easily. The drawback is that the implementation of this
		function differs greatly from server to server. This can sometimes leads to problems,
		such as emails not being properly sent out but not provide any clues that it didn't in fact
		work.
	</p>

	<p>
		With this in mind, we created the <a href="http://modules.formtools.org/swift_mailer/?page=index">Swift
		Mailer module</a>. This module lets you override the default mail() function and send
		all emails via an SMTP email server.
	</p>

	<p>
		For more information about the module, see the
		<a href="http://modules.formtools.org/swift_mailer/?page=index">module's online documentation</a>.
