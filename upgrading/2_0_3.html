	<p>
		With version 2.0.3 (beta 20100908) there was a minor change made to the structure of the
		files: the Themes page was moved out of Settings and into the root, alongside the Modules
		page. After upgrading normally, you'll need to make one small change the administrator's
		menu to place the Themes page at the right spot. Here's how to do it.

			<td valign="top">
				After upgrading, log into Form Tools and go to the Settings Â» Menu page. There,
				edit the administrator's menu. Assuming you haven't customized it, you should see a page
				something like the screenshot to the right. Note that the "Themes" tab is no longer
				there, but the navigation menu on the left still lists it under Settings. That's what
				we're going to fix!
			</td>
			<td>{% include screenshot.html item='i165.gif' %}</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td align="center" valign="top"><b>2</b></td>
			<td valign="top">
				Enter in the values shown in the screenshot: move the Themes page after Modules (by
				entering 5.5 to sandwich it between position 5 and 6); uncheck the "submenu" checkbox
				and click update.
			</td>
			<td>{% include screenshot.html item='i166.gif' %}</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td align="center" valign="top"><b>3</b></td>
			<td valign="top">
				And you're done! You should see the Themes page appear in the left navigation menu in
				its new position: like in the screenshot.
