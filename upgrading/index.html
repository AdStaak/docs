		Form Tools 2 is actually a combination of components: the Core, Modules, Themes and
		the API, and each component needs to be updated individually. Since upgrading
		each component one by one would be rather tiresome, we created a custom upgrade script
		to simplify matters.
	</p>

	<h3>Upgrading 2.0.3 or later</h3>

	<p>
		After logging in, just click the "update" link. This appears in different locations
		depending on your theme. The default theme shows it in the top right; Classic Grey
		and Deep Blue show it in the left navigation menu. Click that link! This submits
		all relevant information about your installation - namely the versions of the
		various components you have installed - to the Form Tools website. We then do the
		job of figuring out what components have been upgrade and generates a custom zipfile containing
		ONLY those files that have changed.
	</p>

	<h3>Upgrading pre-2.0.3 versions</h3>
	<p>
		After logging in, go to the Settings Â» Main tab. Here, next to the version number,
		there's a button labeled "Check for Updates". Click it! This submits all relevant information about
		your installation - namely the versions of the various components you have installed - to
		the Form Tools website. We then do the job of figuring out what components have been upgraded
		recently, and let you generate a custom zipfile containing ONLY those files that have
		changed.
	</p>

	<p>
		After downloading this file, you need to overwrite your existing files. Simple upload the
		entire contents of the <b>formtools/</b> folder to your own installation.
	</p>

	<p>
		And that's it! The various components will be upgraded next time you log in.
	</p>

	<h3>Upgrading Form Tools 1.x to 2.0.x</h3>

	<p>
		Form Tools 1 is very, very old! We used to have an upgrade script to allow you to update to 
		an old version of Form Tools 2, but even that is now out of date. I'm afraid there are no longer
		ways to update to the new versions. You'll need to do a fresh installation of Form Tools 2 - and 
		you may want to hire a developer to port in the data, should you wish.
