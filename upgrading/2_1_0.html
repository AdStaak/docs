		<p>
			<strong>IMPORTANT!</strong>
			A number of things have changed Form Tools 2.1.0. So before upgrading PLEASE read the following.
			Things will change after you upgrade, so don't get caught off-guard.
		</p>
	</div>


	<h3>Back-up your database and files</h3>

	<p>
		I know, I know, everyone always says this and it's easy advice to ignore. But <b>upgrading to 2.1.0 is higher
		risk than upgrading to other versions</b> and actually causes some of your changes to be lost (see below).
	</p>

	<p>
		The upgrade script makes a LOT of changes to your database and in case something goes wrong or you decide
		you don't like something about the new version, you have the option to back-out and return to your old version.
		<b>PLEASE DO THIS!</b>
	</p>


	<h3>Things you should know before choosing to upgrade</h3>

	<ol>
		<li><b>Required Field Type modules</b>. You <i>must</i> install the
			<a href="http://modules.formtools.org/field_type_file/" target="_blank">File
				Upload</a> and the <a href="http://modules.formtools.org/field_type_tinymce/" target="_blank">TinyMCE field</a>
			at the time that you upgrade. This is to ensure backward compatibility. If you don't want
			either of them, you can safely uninstall them later. If you attempt to upgrade without either of them
			installed, the script will whine at you when you try to log in, and tell you you need to install them.
			To include them, check the "show all components" option on the upgrade page and select those modules by
			checking the column in the first column.
		</li>

		<li>
			<b>Your Export Manager module changes will be lost</b><br />
			This sucks, I know, but it was unavoidable. The way the form field types (textboxes,
			textareas, dropdowns etc.) are handled in Form Tools 2.1.0 is very different from
			earlier releases. Because of this, we now feed different information to be used in
			the Export Manager's fields. Any old export type's Smarty markup won't work any more.
			For more information on this, see <a href="http://modules.formtools.org/export_manager/?page=v2changes">this
			page in the Export Manager module documentation</a>.
		</li>

		<li><b>So where's the WYSIWYG settings page?</b><br>
			Gone! The Settings -&gt; WYSIWYG page has been totally removed. All the existing WYSIWYG
			functionality is still available, but it's managed through the
			<a href="http://modules.formtools.org/field_type_tinymce/">TinyMCE Field Type</a> module.
			Upgrading to 2.1.0 or later will automatically remove the WYSIWYG menu item from your
			nav menu. If you liked it there, you can always add it back in by editing the
			administrator's menu.
		</li>

		<li><b>No Media Gallery or Mass Edit module support</b>. The Media Gallery module is
			not going to be updated any more. So if you rely on it, don't upgrade. Also, the Mass Edit module
			is no longer compatible.
		</li>

		<li><b>Date Field changes</b><br>
			In earlier releases, only the Submission Date and Last Modified Date fields were
			real "date" fields - i.e. they showed a datepicker, and the formatting of those dates
			dates was controlled via the format specified in the Settings -&gt; Accounts page. Now,
			any form field may be marked as a date field, and each one may have its own
			date format: e.g. one field could be a date field, another a datetime field. The one
			limitation is that there are fewer date formatting options than before. Things
			like the "th" in "March 6th, 2011" cannot be done, so chances are you will notice that
			the formatting of those fields in your form will change after upgrading.
		</li>

		<li>
			<b>No more "Use Lightbox to display files" setting on the Settings -&gt; Files tab</b><br>
			This has also been removed. Now, if you want to open an image up in a popup, you need
			to select the "Open as image in dialog" option for the field. (Edit Form -&gt; Field Tab -&gt;
			Edit Field -&gt; second tab).
		</li>

		<li>
			<b>Admin username change</b><br>
			The admin username must be only contain alphanumeric characters (0-9, a-z, A-Z) like
			client accounts. If it doesn't fit the bill right now, don't worry: you won't have any
			problems logging in, but you will need to change it whenever you update your info on
			the Your Accounts page.
		</li>
	</ol>
