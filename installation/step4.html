		The fourth step creates your configuration file. The config.php file is the <b>only</b>
		file in Form Tools that stores custom data. It's not included in the original installation
		script or in upgrade packages so it will never be overwritten.
	</p>

	<p>
		This step attempts to create the file automatically. If it cannot, you will need to manually
		create the file by creating it locally in notepad / textedit and FTPing it to your server.
	</p>

	<p>
		The config.php file is located in the <b>/global</b> folder.
