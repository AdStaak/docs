	<p>
		<a href="http://www.hardened-php.net/suhosin/" target="_blank">Suhosin</a> is a PHP
		extension designed to improve the security of PHP installations. Although its motives are
		good, sometimes it can wreak havoc with Form Tools installations. Suhosin lets you limit
		the max size of the GET and POST PHP variables, preventing you from having
		very large forms on your website.
	</p>

	<p>
		You can find out if you have suhosin installed by looking at your php info file. For that, just upload
		a .php file to your server with the following content:

		{% codemirror php %}
		<?php phpinfo(); ?>
		{% endcodemirror %}

		Then load that page in your browser and do a search for "suhosin". The settings that will cause the most
		problems are <b>suhosin.get.max_vars</b> and <b>suhosin.post.max_vars</b>. Anything under a few thousand
		will cause problems - if not with your forms, then with the Form Tools UI when trying to
		manage your forms.
