		Step 1 of the installation script is just a welcome screen, and lets you choose your
		language for both the installation script and Form Tools itself. The language packs are
		found in the /global/lang folder, and can be downloaded from
		the <a href="http://translations.formtools.org">Translations page</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		You can always change the languages later on, so you may want to just continue with the
		English language.
