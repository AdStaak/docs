	<h4>Overview</h4>

	<p>
		The simplest way to store form submission data is by submitting your form to
		<b>process.php</b>; the information is stored, the user is redirect to some sort of
		"thank you"page and everyone gets on with their life. This method, though the
		simplest, doesn't allow for more complicated scenarios, such as:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>You want to add server-side validation to ensure the information is valid before
			adding to the database.</li>
		<li>You have a multi-page form and need to submit the data only on the very last
			step.</li>
		<li>You have a multi-page form and need to store the data page-by-page as the user
			progresses through the form.</li>
		<li>You want to submit the information, but don't want it to appear in the Form Tools
			UI until a later date.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Enter the API. The API comes with a number of functions designed to let you submit the
		information via PHP code, rather than through the more restrictive
		<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/form_management/add_form_step3">process.php POST
			script</a>. The most important of these functions is the <b>ft_api_process_form()</b>
		function. For those of you familiar with earlier version of Form Tools, this function
		replaces the older <b>process_form()</b> function used for "code" submission types,
		and was found in the (now deprecated) process_code.php file.
	</p>

	<p>
		Fundamentally, Form Tools doesn't care HOW the information gets into the database.
		What's important is that it gets there.
	</p>

	<h4>Finalizing submissions</h4>

	<p>
		Every form submissions in the Form Tools database has a finalized flag: "yes" or "no".
		By default, submissions sent via
		<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/form_management/page=add_form_step3">process.php</a> are set
		to finalized. Submissions sent via <b>ft_api_process_form()</b> are NOT finalized.
		Only finalized submissions appear in Form Tools.
	</p>

	<p>
		To understand the ft_api_process_form() function the best, we suggest you give one of the
		following tutorials a read.
	</p>

	<ul>

	</ul>

	<h4>Parameter keys</h4>

	<p>
		For completion, here's all the values that may be passed via the single parameter
		(a hash). But we <b>strongly</b> suggest giving one of the above tutorials a read first,
		otherwise this won't make all that much sense.
	</p>

	<p><b>1. Required keys</b></p>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-4">submit_button</div>
		<div class="col-lg-8">
			The name attribute of your submit button. This is needed to let the function know
			when to try to process the form. If the name attribute isn't in the POST request,
			the function does nothing.
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-4">form_data</div>
		<div class="col-lg-8">
			Generally this is the $_POST or $_GET. It contains the contents of the form just
			submitted.
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-4">file_data</div>
		<div class="col-lg-8">
			If your form contains one or more file upload fields, you'll need to include this key,
			passing along the $_FILES value ("file_data" =&gt; $_FILES).
		</div>
	</div>


	<p><b>2. Optional keys</b></p>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-5">next_page</div>
		<div class="col-lg-7">
			The URL (relative or absolute) of which page to redirect to (e.g. the next page
			in the form or the "thankyou" page). If this isn't defined, it doesn't redirect
			anywhere.
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-5">finalize</div>
		<div class="col-lg-7">
			This tells the function to finalize the submission. This makes the submission appear
			in the Form Tools UI, so generally you'll only want to pass this value on the final
			step of your form - otherwise, for multi-page forms, incomplete submissions will appear
			in the Form Tools interface.
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-5">no_sessions_url</div>
		<div class="col-lg-7">
			For multi-page forms it's a good idea to pass along this value. It should be the URL
			of a page (usually the FIRST page in the form sequence) where the user will be
			redirected to if they didn't start the form from the first page. It ensures the form
			submission gets created &amp; submitted properly.
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-5">may_update_finalized_submissions</div>
		<div class="col-lg-7">
			This is pretty descriptive! It lets you control whether or not a finalized
			submission may be updated or not. It's set to true by default, as of 1.0.0.
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-5">namespace</div>
		<div class="col-lg-7">
			If you specified a custom namespace for ft_api_init_form_page, for where the form
			values will be stored temporarily in sessions, you need to pass that same value to
			this function - otherwise it won't be able to retrieve the form and submission ID.
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-5">send_emails</div>
		<div class="col-lg-7">
			Added in 1.0.1. (boolean). By default, Form Tools will trigger any emails that have
			been attached to the "on submission" event ONLY when the submission is finalized
			(finalize=true). This setting provides you with direct control over when the emails
			get sent. If not specified, will use the default behaviour.
		</div>
	</div>
