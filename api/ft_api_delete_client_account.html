	<p>
		This function deletes a client account programmatically. Note: it only deletes client accounts, not the
		administrator. It completely removes all references to the client account from the database, including
		client-form and client-view omit lists, as email recipients and everywhere else.
	</p>

	<p>
		Usage is very simple. It accepts a single parameter: the unique account ID.
	</p>
