	<p>
		This function should always be called on the final "thankyou" page of your form. The
		two functions, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/api/ft_api_init_form_page">ft_api_init_form_page</a> and
		<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/api/ft_api_process_form">ft_api_process_form</a> store various values in
		sessions (a built-in PHP temporary storage mechanism) while the user progresses through
		your form. This function clears them.
	</p>

	<div class="alert alert-warning">
		Note: it appears there may be an issue with this function: you must include the following
		line before calling <b>ft_api_clear_form_sessions</b> otherwise your sessions may not be
		cleared:

		{% highlight php %}
$fields = ft_api_init_form_page(X); // where X is your form ID
		{% endhighlight %}
	</div>

	<h4>Why is this needed?</h4>

	<p>
		If the sessions aren't emptied, the user may not be able to put through a second form
		submission. The reason for this is that when they return to the form, the API functions
		may well load the old submission ID from the <i>previous</i> submission. Then, when it
		comes to updating the submission information, it will realize that the submission has
		already been finalized by the original form submission - and fail!
	</p>

	<h4>Usage</h4>

	<p>
		The function is generally called without any parameters. It has no return value.
	</p>

	{% highlight php %}
<?php
ft_api_clear_form_sessions();
?>
	{% endhighlight %}

	<p>
		If you originally passed a custom sessions namespace string to the
		<a href="?page=ft_api_init_form_page">ft_api_init_form_page</a> function, you need to pass
		the same namespace string to this function. For example, if your namespace was "my_form",
		you'd call this function like so:
	</p>

	{% highlight php %}
<?php
ft_api_clear_form_sessions("my_form");
?>
	{% endhighlight %}


{% include close_section.html %}
