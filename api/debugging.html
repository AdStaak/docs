	<p>
		The API has a single $g_api_debug variable used to toggle debugging mode on and off for
		all the API functions. By default, debugging is <b>enabled</b>.
	</p>

	<p>
		When you're in debugging mode, any time an error occurs it halts your code and displays
		the error in the webpage. The errors consistent of the error type ("user" or "system")
		and the unique error code. The error code is a link to the online help documentation
		which describes the nature of the error - and maybe a tip or two to solve it. Error
		types indicate the severity of the error. "user" errors indicate that the function has
		been fed an incorrect value or two; "system" errors mean that some worse has happened:
		either a file is missing or there's a bug on our end!
	</p>

	<p>
		Generally, you should find that errors only occur when you're in the midst of development,
		so you can leave it perpetually in debugging mode. However, if you want to be extra careful,
		you can you can deactivate debugging in two ways. One, by adding the following line in
		every file where you include the API library file:
	</p>

	{% codemirror php %}
<?php
require_once("/path/to/global/api/API.class.php");
$g_api_debug = false;
?>
	{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		Or, you can just add the following line to your /global/config.php file:
	</p>

{% codemirror php %}
$g_api_debug = true;
{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		Once this is done, the API functions will no longer display the error messages; instead,
		they will return them programmatically which you can handle in whatever way you see fit.
		See each function for more information on the return values.
