	<p>
		When you use the API for your forms, it uses sessions to store information about the form
		as the user progresses from page to page. Prior to version <b>1.0.0-beta-20090908</b> of the
		API, it always used PHP sessions to store the information. After that release, it uses EITHER
		database or PHP sessions, depending on what value you have set in your
		<b>$g_api_session_type</b> variable (<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/getting_started/config_file/">see
		here</a> for more information). If you have problems with PHP sessions, it's recommended
		that you set that value to "database"
	</p>

	<p>
		To control the timeout for the database sessions, set the
		<b>$g_api_session_timeout</b> value to something appropriate. This is in seconds and defaults
		to 3600 (1 hour). Again, see the
		<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/getting_started/config_file/">help documentation on the config.php file</a>
		for more information.
