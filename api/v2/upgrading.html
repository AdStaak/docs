	<p>
        When upgrading to Form Tools 3 by download an upgrade package from the Form Tools website it will include
        version 2.x of the API. In terms of your own form integration, no further work is necessary: it should all just
        "work".
	</p>

    <p>
        Here's what's happening. The old <code>api.php</code> file used in API v1.x contains the function reference
        (PHP functions of the form <code>ft_api_*</code> which you'll have used in your code). This file has been
        replaced with simple wrapper methods with the same name as the old methods. These now call the new <code>API.class.php</code>
        class methods. This is what allows for a seamless upgrade.
