{% include open_section.html nav='nav_api_v2.html' selected='clear_form_sessions' nav_width=4 %}

	<p>
		This function should always be called on the final "thankyou" page of your form. The two functions,
        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/api/v2/init_form_page">initFormPage()</a> and
        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/api/v2/process_form_submission">processFormSubmission()</a> store various values in
		sessions (a built-in PHP temporary storage mechanism) while the user progresses through your form. This
        function clears them.
	</p>

	<div class="alert alert-warning">
		Note: you must include the following line before calling <code>clearFormSessions()</code> otherwise your
        sessions may not be cleared:

		{% codemirror php %}
$api = new FormTools\API();
$fields = $api->initFormPage(X); // where X is your form ID
		{% endcodemirror %}
	</div>

	<h3>Why is this needed?</h3>

	<p>
		If the sessions aren't emptied, the user may not be able to put through a second form
		submission. The reason for this is that when they return to the form, the API functions
		may well load the old submission ID from the <i>previous</i> submission. Then, when it
		comes to updating the submission information, it will realize that the submission has
		already been finalized by the original form submission - and fail!
	</p>

	<h3>Usage</h3>

	<p>
		The function is generally called without any parameters. It has no return value.
	</p>

	{% codemirror php %}
<?php
$api = new FormTools\API();
$fields = $api->clearFormSessions();
?>
	{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		If you originally passed a custom sessions namespace string to the
		<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/api/v2/init_form_page">initFormPage()</a> function, you need to pass
		the same namespace string to this function. For example, if your namespace was "my_form",
		you'd call this function like so:
	</p>

	{% codemirror php %}
<?php
$api = new FormTools\API();
$fields = $api->clearFormSessions("my_form");
?>
	{% endcodemirror %}


{% include close_section.html %}
