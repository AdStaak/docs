{% include open_section.html nav='nav_api_v2.html' selected='show_submission_count' nav_width=4 %}

	<p>
		This function displays the number of submissions in a form. It takes a second optional View ID parameter that
		limits the count to those results in a particular View. This is only needed for those instances where you've
		created a View that uses a filter to show a <b>subset</b> of the form submissions, e.g. the number of male
		applicants or the number of submissions that have been sent to a particular department in your company.
	</p>

	<p>
		The function takes the following required parameters:
	</p>

	{% codemirror php %}
<?php
$api = new FormTools\API();
echo $api->showSubmissionCount($form_id);
?>
	{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		Or, if you're specifying a View:
	</p>

	{% codemirror php %}
<?php
$api = new FormTools\API();
echo $api->showSubmissionCount($form_id, $view_id);
?>
	{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		You would call it in your webpage (a PHP page) by embedding the following code. Note that you'll need to
		replace 4 and 6 with your form and View IDs:
	</p>

	{% codemirror php %}
<?php
$api = new FormTools\API();
echo $api->showSubmissionCount(4, 6);
?>
	{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		To use the submission count value in your own code, just store it in a variable, like so:
	</p>

	{% codemirror php %}
<?php
$api = new FormTools\API();
$num_submissions = $api->showSubmissionCount(4, 6);
?>
	{% endcodemirror %}
