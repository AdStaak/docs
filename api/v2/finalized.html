	<p>
		When working with the API for form integrations, there's one concept you should know about: <i>finalization</i>.
        With <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/form_management/form_types/">external POST forms</a>, submissions are
        immediately visible in the Form Tools interface after the user submits the form. But with the API, it's a little
        more subtle. Say you have a multi-page form - you might only want those submissions to appear in the Form Tools
        interface after the user has completed all steps of the form. And what about people that started filling in a
        form but never completed it? In those cases, you probably wouldn't want to see the submission ever.
	</p>

	<p>
		To let you control the visibility of these submissions in the Form Tools interface, when using the API you need
        to explicitly finalize the submissions. This is generally done on the final step of your form. You'll read more
        about finalization in the
		<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/api/v2/process_form_submission">processFormSubmission()</a> function and
		<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/api/v2/delete_unfinalized_submissions">deleteUnfinalizedSubmissions()</a>
		class methods. For now, it's enough that you understand the idea!
