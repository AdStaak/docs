    <p class="alert alert-warning">
        <b>Please note</b>: this method and its configuration have changed from Form Tools 2.
    </p>

    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p class="alert alert-info">
        The <code>displayCaptcha()</code> method is for adding a CAPTCHA to your API forms, to help combat spam.
    </p>

	<p>
		The API comes fully integrated with the <b>reCAPTCHA</b> service, offered by Google.
		<a href="https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/" target="_blank">Click here</a> to visit their website and
        learn more.
	</p>

	<p>
		This API method generates a CAPTCHA in your page with a single line of PHP. Unlike earlier CAPTCHAs, the
        new version
	</p>

	<p>
		This document explains how to get this function working for you.
	</p>

	<h3>1. Set up reCAPTCHA for your website</h3>

	<ul>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin" target="_blank">Visit the reCAPTCHA site here</a>
            and sign up for an API key pair.</li>
        <li>Once you've created an account you register the domain(s) where you're using the service. Since the API only runs on
            the same server as your Form Tools installation, you'll only need to set up the one domain. You will need
            to choose the <b>reCAPTCHA V2</b> option.
        </li>
        <li>
            Tip: if you're developing locally, you can enter both <b>localhost</b> and <b>127.0.0.1</b> in the Domains
            section.
        </li>
    </ul>

	<p>
        Once it's set up, reCAPTCHA will generate two keys for you: a <b>site key</b> and a <b>secret key</b>. Add those
        two values to your Form Tools <code>global/config.php</code> file, like so:
	</p>

	{% codemirror php %}
$g_api_recaptcha_site_key = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";
$g_api_recaptcha_secret_key = "yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy";
	{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		(replace the x's and y's with your own keys).
	</p>

	<h3>2. Add the reCAPTCHA to your form</h3>

	<p>
		In your form (which should already be integrated with the API with help from the tutorials
		on <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/api_v2_single_page_form">adding a single page form </a> and
		<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/api_v2_multi_page_form">adding a multi-page form</a>), add this line
        wherever you want.
	</p>

	{% codemirror php %}
<?php
// Reminder: you should only include this next line ONCE per form page
$api = new FormTools\API();
$api->displayCaptcha();
?>
	{% endcodemirror %}

    <p>
        At this point, if you refresh your web browser you should see the captcha appear in the page. So far so good!
        Next, we want to explicitly tell the API that this page contains a CAPTCHA so no-one can circumvent the test
        by modifying the POST request. Add a new <b>"has_captcha" => true</b> key-value pair to your
        <code>processFormSubmission()</code> method call, like so:
    </p>

    {% codemirror php %}
$params = array(
    // ...
    "has_captcha" => true
);
$api->processFormSubmission($params);
    {% endcodemirror %}

    <p>
        Great! Now your CAPTCHA is working on your form. Try submitting your form without checking the "I'm not a robot"
        field. You should get redirected back to the same page and not continue.
    </p>

    <h3>Validation errors</h3>

    <p>
        Unlike earlier CAPTCHAs where user mistakes were common, the new ones are just a checkbox - not much room for
        error! Nevertheless, if you'd like to catch for errors here's how to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The default behaviour for the <code>displayCaptcha()</code> method is to display a simple "There was a reCAPTCHA error."
        message in English in a div with a <code>.form_tools_recaptcha_error</code> class in the page above the CAPTCHA.
        If you'd like to fine-fune this, just pass in a single <code>false</code> property to the <code>displayCaptcha()</code>
        method and that will suppress the error.
    </p>

    <p>
        To add your own error message in the page (wherever you want it) just check for the <code>$GLOBALS["g_api_recaptcha_error"]</code>
        property. That will be set after an error and contain the error response from the Google recaptcha validation
        method.
    </p>
