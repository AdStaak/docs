	<h3>Overview</h3>

	<p>
		The simplest way to store form submission data is by submitting your form to <b>process.php</b>; the
        information is stored, the user is redirect to some sort of "thank you"page and everyone gets on with their
        life. But this approach doesn't handle more complicated scenarios such as:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>You want to add server-side validation to ensure the information is valid before adding to the database.</li>
		<li>You have a multi-page form and need to submit the data only on the very last step.</li>
		<li>You have a multi-page form and need to store the data page-by-page as the user progresses through the form.</li>
		<li>You want to submit the information, but don't want it to appear in the Form Tools UI until a later date.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Enter the API. The API comes with a number of methods designed to let you submit the information via PHP code,
        rather than through the more restrictive <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/form_management/add_form_step3">process.php
        POST script</a>. The most important of these functions is the <b>processFormSubmission()</b> class method.
	</p>

	<p>
		Fundamentally, Form Tools doesn't care HOW the information gets into the database. What's important is that it
        gets there.
	</p>

	<h3>Finalizing submissions</h3>

	<p>
		Every form submissions in the Form Tools database has a finalized flag: "yes" or "no". By default, submissions
        sent via <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/form_management/page=add_form_step3">process.php</a> are set to
        finalized. Submissions sent via <code>processFormSubmission()</code> are NOT finalized. Only finalized submissions
        appear in Form Tools.
	</p>

	<h3>Related Links</h3>

	<p>
		To understand the <b>processFormSubmission()</b> method better, we suggest reading one of these
        tutorials:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/api_single_page_form/">Tutorial: Adding a single-page form with the API</a></li>
		<li><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/api_multi_page_form/">Tutorial: Adding a multi-page form with the API</a></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Parameter keys</h3>

	<p>
		For completion, here's all the values that may be passed via the single parameter (a hash). But we
        <b>strongly</b> suggest giving one of the above tutorials a read first, otherwise this won't make all that much
        sense.
	</p>

	<p><b>1. Required keys</b></p>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-4">submit_button</div>
		<div class="col-lg-8">
			The name attribute of your submit button. This is needed to let the function know
			when to try to process the form. If the name attribute isn't in the POST request,
			the function does nothing.
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-4">form_data</div>
		<div class="col-lg-8">
			Generally this is the $_POST or $_GET. It contains the contents of the form just
			submitted.
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-4">file_data</div>
		<div class="col-lg-8">
			If your form contains one or more file upload fields, you'll need to include this key,
			passing along the $_FILES value ("file_data" =&gt; $_FILES).
		</div>
	</div>


	<p><b>2. Optional keys</b></p>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-5">next_page</div>
		<div class="col-lg-7">
			The URL (relative or absolute) of which page to redirect to (e.g. the next page
			in the form or the "thankyou" page). If this isn't defined, it doesn't redirect
			anywhere.
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-5">finalize</div>
		<div class="col-lg-7">
			This tells the function to finalize the submission. This makes the submission appear
			in the Form Tools UI, so generally you'll only want to pass this value on the final
			step of your form - otherwise, for multi-page forms, incomplete submissions will appear
			in the Form Tools interface.
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-5">no_sessions_url</div>
		<div class="col-lg-7">
			For multi-page forms it's a good idea to pass along this value. It should be the URL
			of a page (usually the FIRST page in the form sequence) where the user will be
			redirected to if they didn't start the form from the first page. It ensures the form
			submission gets created &amp; submitted properly.
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-5">may_update_finalized_submissions</div>
		<div class="col-lg-7">
			This is pretty descriptive! It lets you control whether or not a finalized
			submission may be updated or not. It's set to true by default, as of 1.0.0.
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-5">namespace</div>
		<div class="col-lg-7">
			If you specified a custom namespace for <code>initFormPage()</code>, for where the form
			values will be stored temporarily in sessions, you need to pass that same value to
			this function - otherwise it won't be able to retrieve the form and submission ID.
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-5">send_emails</div>
		<div class="col-lg-7">
			Added in 1.0.1. (boolean). By default, Form Tools will trigger any emails that have
			been attached to the "on submission" event ONLY when the submission is finalized
			(finalize=true). This setting provides you with direct control over when the emails
			get sent. If not specified, will use the default behaviour.
		</div>
	</div>
