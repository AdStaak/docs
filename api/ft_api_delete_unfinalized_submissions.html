	<h4>The problem</h4>

	<p>
		This page explains a problem that arises from using the API for your forms. If you don't
		have any on your server, you don't have anything to worry about! Move along, move
		along please.
	</p>
	<p>
		For multi-page forms, it's entirely possible that some users will begin entering the form but never
		complete it. As you probably know, Form Tools accounts for this by only "finalizing" the submission
		(i.e. making it appear in the UI) when it's explicitly told to do so. This is generally done on the very
		final step of your form.
	</p>

	<p>
		But what about all those orphaned, unfinalized submissions? Well, they end up hidden in
		the database, never to be used or seen again. Generally, this is not a big deal. In fact,
		during the entire lifespan of Form Tools 1.x (which uses a similar finalization
		mechanism), no-one once asked about this in the forums (!).  A little database clutter
		isn't a disaster, but it would be nice to avoid.
	</p>

	<p>
		Now onto the <b>real</b> problem. What if your form contains one or more file upload
		fields? What happens to those files that are attached to these unfinalized submissions?
		Exactly: they end up on your server, wasting valuable disk space. With the new API
		functions in Form Tools 2, this could become a real problem. The
		ft_api_process_form function significantly improves the file uploading mechanism to
		allow file uploads on any page - hence, could result in files being uploaded that are
		associated with submissions that never get finalized. So they end up stored on your server
		indefinitely. Boo.
	</p>

	<h4>The solution</h4>

	<p>
		Enter the ft_api_delete_unfinalized_submissions function. This function does the job
		of both deleting those unfinalized submissions and associated files, keeping your server nice and tidy.
	</p>

	<p>
		It takes two parameters: the required form ID, and optional parameter: a boolean (true / false).
	</p>

	{% codemirror php %}
ft_api_delete_unfinalized_submissions($form_id, false);
	{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		If the second parameter is set to true, it deletes ALL unfinalized submissions in the
		database - everything made up to this very moment. By default, it's set to false. The
		default setting is that it deletes all unfinalized submissions that have been made
		more than 2 hours ago. This is because it assumes that people may be in the process of
		putting through a form - you don't want to delete those unfinalized submissions! So
		in 99% of cases, leave the second parameter to <b>false</b>.
	</p>

	<h4>Return Value</h4>

	<p>
		This function returns the number of unfinalized submissions that it just deleted.
	</p>
